So, it turns out that all those algorithms for dating websites are no better than just pairing two strangers at random."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u6beb\u65e0\u7528\u5904\u3002\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u5462\uff1f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u81ea\u514b\u52b3\u65af\xb7\u97e6\u5fb7\u91d1\u5fb7\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5fb7\u56fd\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u201cT\u6064\u7814\u7a76\u201d\u3002\n\u5973\u6027\u55c5\u95fb\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7537\u6027\u7a7f\u4e86\u4e24\u5929\u7684T\u6064\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u5979\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95fb\u8d77\u6765\u6700\u597d\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\u3002\n\u97e6\u5fb7\u91d1\u5fb7\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u8fd9\u4e00\u514d\u75ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u6700\u6709\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7537\u6027\u7684T\u6064\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u514b\u9686\u4f53\u3002\n\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4eba\u90fd\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002\n\u5728\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5927\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u4e8e2006\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf948\u5bf9\u592b\u5987\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u56e0\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u592b\u5987\u4e2d\u7684\u5973\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\n\u800c\u90a3\u4e9b\u57fa\u56e0\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5973\u6027\u5219\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7537\u6027\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u8f68\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u90a3\u4e9b\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u4f1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u5339\u914d\u4e24\u4e2a\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u66f4\u597d\u3002"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"What\u2019s the alternative?

As usual, we started with data. Couples volunteered to go on these dates and agreed to record their most intimate conversations and upload the recordings to a secure site. For the couples whose stories and conversations we share in this book, we have changed their identifying details and kept them anonymous. The conversations in this book are brave and vulnerable conversations, and we\u2019re grateful for those couples who agreed to record and share their most intimate discussions. The participants ranged in age from 21 to 67. Twenty-five percent of the couples were dating, 11 percent were in a committed relationship but not planning to marry, 32 percent were engaged or planning to marry, and 32 percent were married.

Alice doesn\u2019t look back and doesn\u2019t question the adventure she\u2019s chosen. That\u2019s commitment. You two never did that. You have the trappings of commitment and loyalty, but you go to a party and think someone else can meet your needs better. You don\u2019t like each other\u2019s behavior and think that means they\u2019re not the one for you. When you negotiate with each other, it\u2019s always from a point of self-interest, not mutual benefit.

When we fall in love we are often on our very best behavior. We lead with the healthiest side of ourselves. But as relationships progress, each person gets more real, more transparent, and therefore more vulnerable. None of us has it all together, and none of us is without our idiosyncrasies or insecurities no matter how together we may appear. And here\u2019s where the real magic comes in\u2014the more honest we are, the more we can discover that our partner really loves us for who we are, and not the idealized version of us that shows up when we first begin to date. Vulnerability creates trust, and trust is the oxygen your relationship needs to breathe. Trust is also built over time, and over lots of conversations\u2014like the ones Ben and Leah had, and the ones you\u2019ll have in this book. Trust is the backdrop to any relationship. It\u2019s an action word\u2014both a verb and a noun. Trust happens in the little moments when we show our partner we are there for them and they do the same for us. Trust is built in small moments of attuning to our partner, and listening like a friend and ally when our partner is experiencing a negative emotion\u2014sadness, anger, disgust, or fear, even if those emotions are about us. In all of our decisions we\u2019re thinking of maximizing our partner\u2019s benefits as well as our own. Mutual trust rests in the belief that both of us are thinking for two.

If you genuinely seek understanding of your partner\u2019s position, you can create deeper intimacy and a stronger relationship, through any disagreement.

It\u2019s all a normal part of human sexuality, and it\u2019s all okay. To begin your relationship or marriage saying we\u2019re going to have sex every single day is a setup for failure.

One researcher in this study told us that the dual-career couples talked to one another an average of 35 minutes a week, and most of that talk was about errands. Therefore, many couples eventually stop doing the romantic things with one another that sustain a loving relationship. They stop having fun. They stop making time for playfulness.

In happy couples, there is no anger or defensiveness if one partner isn\u2019t in the mood. According to our research, each of you isn\u2019t going to be in the mood 25 percent of the time that your partner is in the mood. Finding a way to handle the \u201cno\u201d is critical to the success of your relationship. Find ways to be affectionate and be together, even if sex has been taken off the table. Those couples who have mastered acceptance of the no, actually end up having sex more than couples where one partner gets upset when the other one isn\u2019t in the mood. A great way to respond to no is realizing that \u201cno\u201d does not have to end connection. Then one can say, \u201cThanks for telling me you\u2019re not in the mood. What are you in the mood for? Do you feel like taking a walk? Watching TV? Cuddling? Just talking? Or would you like time alone?\u201d It\u2019s important not to punish one\u2019s partner for saying no. Don\u2019t sulk or whine. It\u2019s especially hard for men to hear \u201cno,\u201d because research shows that being wanted sexually is essential to a man\u2019s sense of his masculinity. There\u2019s even been a study showing that men would prefer to get fired from their job rather than have their partner not want them sexually. If there is a lack of physical affection, flirting, and intimate connection apart from sex, your sex life will suffer. If there\u2019s emotional distance or intense conflict, like we discussed in the previous chapter, your sex life will suffer. It there\u2019s a lack of physical or emotional safety, or if one of you doesn\u2019t feel appreciated, it can affect both the quality and quantity of your sex life.

Kiss a lot. Kiss often. Kiss each time you leave each other, and each time you see each other again after being apart. And we\u2019re not talking about a peck on the lips like you would give your grandmother; we recommend a juicy, 6-second kiss that would make your grandmother\u2014or anyone else watching the two of you\u2014blush. When you kiss passionately, you set off a chemical cascade of hormones and neurotransmitters that release dopamine and increase oxytocin, both of which make you feel good. Really good. If you really mean it when you kiss, your blood vessels will dilate, your brain will receive extra oxygen, your pupils will dilate, and your cheeks will flush. Lips are our body\u2019s most exposed erogenous zone and are associated with a disproportionately large part of the brain. The brain literally lights up with a good kiss, and kissing activates 5 out of 12 cranial nerves. More important, though, for those 6 seconds when you leave each other and when you return to each other, you are disconnecting from the world outside and reconnecting with your partner and the world you are creating together.

You can\u2019t just thinkpositive things about your partner, you need to verbalizethem to your partner. Appreciate their efforts, their attractiveness, their intelligence, their work, their skills, their sense of humor, and whatever else about them you love and admire. The Love Lab found that successful relationships have a 20 to 1 ratio of positive to negative in all their everyday interactions in the apartment lab. This means for every one time you roll your eyes at something your partner says or does, you need to counteract this with 20 positive responses and reactions. When they want your attention, you give it to them. You ask how each other\u2019s day went while making eye contact, you talk about the things that are stressing them out, you listen to them, and you empathize with their struggles. Every time you\u2019re together there is an opportunity to learn more about each other and become closer. When you are apart, send love texts, or flirt with each other over the phone or by email. Let your partner know you are thinking about them and loving them. These little acts and stolen moments of connection\u2014the kind that happen outside the bedroom\u2014are exactly what will keep the passion in your relationship alive far more than any wild tricks you might try out behind closed doors.
