isn\u2019t new information. All the algorithms for matching people are mostly worthless.\nWhy is that the case? Well, one explanation is offered by the classic German study by Claus Wedekind, called the T-shirt study.\nWomen smelled T-shirts worn by various men for two days and picked the ones they thought smelled the best.\nWedekind discovered that women preferred T-shirts of men who were the most genetically diverse from themselves\non the major histocompatibility complex of the immune system.\nSo, we\u2019re definitely not looking for our clone.\nWe are, in fact, attracted to many kinds of people who are very different from ourselves.\nIn a 2006 study conducted at the University of New Mexico of 48 couples, women in couples more genetically diverse\nfrom one another reported having a higher degree of sexual satisfaction,\nwhile those women with similar genes reported having more fantasies about other men and were also more likely to cheat.\nSo, it turns out that all those algorithms for dating websites are no better than just pairing two strangers at random."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u6beb\u65e0\u7528\u5904\u3002\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u5462\uff1f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u81ea\u514b\u52b3\u65af\xb7\u97e6\u5fb7\u91d1\u5fb7\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5fb7\u56fd\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u201cT\u6064\u7814\u7a76\u201d\u3002\n\u5973\u6027\u55c5\u95fb\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7537\u6027\u7a7f\u4e86\u4e24\u5929\u7684T\u6064\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u5979\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95fb\u8d77\u6765\u6700\u597d\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\u3002\n\u97e6\u5fb7\u91d1\u5fb7\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u5728\u514d\u75ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff08MHC\uff09\u4e0a\u57fa\u56e0\u6700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7537\u6027\u7684T\u6064\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u514b\u9686\u4f53\u3002\n\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4eba\u90fd\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002\n\u5728\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5927\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u4e8e2006\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf948\u5bf9\u4f34\u4fa3\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u56e0\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4f34\u4fa3\u4e2d\u7684\u5973\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\n\u800c\u90a3\u4e9b\u57fa\u56e0\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5973\u6027\u5219\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7537\u6027\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u8f68\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u90a3\u4e9b\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u4f1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u5339\u914d\u4e24\u4e2a\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u66f4\u597d\u3002"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"What\u2019s the alternative?

Luckily for them, there is no correlation between couples having common interests and relationship happiness. What this means is, you don\u2019t have to play in the same ways to be a happy couple or to keep the fun alive in your relationship. But you both still have to play. And share your solo play with each other in the form of pictures, stories, and discussing how it made you feel.

But as we\u2019ve said, playing is important throughout our lives. Play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith has written over 50 books on what play means in our lives as children and as adults. Sutton-Smith says, \u201cThe opposite of play is not work\u2014it\u2019s depression.\u201d When our lives are infused with play, we\u2019re able to see the absurd in the serious and find excitement in the mundane."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"A relationship without play is a relationship without humor, without flirting, without games, and without fantasy. We all need humor, laughter, and play. Romance is play. Banter is play. Taking a walk is play. You don\u2019t have to join a sports league or carve out large amounts of free time in your week. You just have to bring a spirit of play into whatever you are doing. Play needs to be a priority. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that after all the work is done, then you will play together. It won\u2019t happen. If it feels foreign at first, then schedule play into your weekly list of tasks to accomplish. Need to get the grocery shopping done? Make a game of it with your partner. Paying the monthly bills? See how flirtatious you can be with each other while writing out those checks. Your happiness individually and as a couple doesn\u2019t consist of not having bad experiences, it\u2019s about constantly generating good experiences. Remember the all-important ratio of positive to negative experiences during nonconflict interaction: 20 positive experiences for every negative one. Play is also how we do that. None of us wants to end up on the wrong side of the divorce statistics, and as Stuart Brown says, when you \u201ctake play out of the mix, a relationship becomes a survival endurance contest.\u201d Doesn\u2019t sound very romantic, does it?
