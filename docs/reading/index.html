From the first
tentative questions we ask as we get to know one another, to the nail-biting
discussions of trust and commitment, to the most profound heart-to-heart
explorations of our love, our pain, and our dreams, it’s the quality of our
questions and our answers that allow us to continue learning and growing
with one another through the years. And when conflict comes, as it
inevitably does when we weave two lives together, it’s our commitment to
being curious rather than correct that allows us to turn toward instead of
away from one another in the moments of disagreement. Whether you and
your partner are talkative or quiet, the words that pass between you, as well
as the expressions and gestures that accompany those words, will define
and determine your relationship. A true love story isn’t a fairy tale. It takes
vulnerability and effort. The reward is that you love your partner more on
your fiftieth anniversary than you did on your wedding night. You can stay in love forever.</p><p><strong><em>欢迎来到约会之夜</em></strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="重要的对话">重要的对话<a class="hash-link" href="#重要的对话" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>每一个伟大的爱情故事都是一场永无止境的对话。从我们相互了解时提出的第一个试探性问题，
到对信任和承诺的尖锐讨论，再到对我们的爱、我们的痛苦和我们的梦想最深刻的心与心的探索，
它是我们间问题和答案的价值，让我们能够在这些年里不断学习，相互成长。
当冲突不可避免地出现在我们将两个人的生活交织在一起时，正是我们致力于“好奇”而不是“正确”，让我们在发生分歧时，转向而不是远离对方。
无论你和你的伴侣是健谈还是沉默寡言，你们之间的话语，以及伴随这些话语的表情和手势，都将定义和决定你们的关系。
真实的爱情故事不是童话。它需要示弱和努力。奖励是你们在五十周年纪念日比新婚之夜更爱你们的伴侣。你们可以永远相爱。</p><p>It can seem as if the success or failure of a marriage or long-term
relationship is no more certain than a coin toss. In the United States, we
hear that more than half of all marriages end in divorce. In Portugal, the
number is 70 percent. With second marriages in the US, the divorce rate
rises to 65 percent, and for third marriages the divorce rate climbs to 75 percent.
Those are bad odds. And those are just the folks who call it quits. What
about the couples who stay together in a state of quiet desperation,
discontent, and dullness? Before you throw your hands up in despair, know
that there is also hope.</p><p>似乎婚姻或长期关系的成败并不比掷硬币更确定。在美国，我们听说超过一半的婚姻以离婚告终。
在葡萄牙，这个数字是 70%。在美国，第二次婚姻的离婚率上升到 65%，第三次婚姻的离婚率上升到 75%。
这些概率真糟糕。而且那些仅包括退出婚姻的人。那些在平静的绝望、不满和沉闷中呆在一起的夫妻呢？
在你绝望地举手之前，要知道还有希望。</p><p>While the expectations for marriage and partnership have never been
higher, and the challenges have never been greater, it isn’t a coin toss. It’s
not chance. It’s choice.</p><p>虽然对婚姻和伴侣关系的期望从未如此高，挑战也从未如此巨大，但这并不是掷硬币。这不是偶然。这是选择。</p><p>We now know what couples can do to improve the odds.
For 40 years the Gottman Love Lab has been studying how to win at love.
In the lab in Seattle we have obtained synchronized observational, self-report, and physiological data from couples,
and we have analyzed our data using advanced mathematical methods.
After observing thousands of couples, we now know the areas in a couple’s life that cause the most struggle.
We can tell you with confidence what separates the masters of relationship from the disasters.
And we can lead you through the eight essential conversations that will give you the best chance at creating your own happily ever after.</p><p>我们现在知道夫妻可以做些什么来提高概率。40年来，戈特曼爱情实验室一直在研究如何赢得爱情。
在西雅图的实验室中，我们从夫妻那里获得了同步观察、自我报告和生理数据，并且我们使用先进的数学方法分析了我们的数据。
在观察了数以千计的夫妻之后，我们现在知道了夫妻生活中最容易引起困扰的领域。
我们可以自信地告诉您，是什么让优秀的夫妻关系与糟糕的关系有所区别。
并且我们可以带领您进行八次必要的对话，为您创造自己的美好结局提供最佳机会。</p><p>Successful long-term relationships are created through small words,small gestures, and small acts.
A lifetime of love is created every single day you are together.
Getting to know your partner doesn’t end the minute you return the moving van and are sharing dresser-drawer space,
or the minute you say “I do.” It never ends.
You can spend a lifetime being curious about the inner world of your partner,
and being brave enough to share your own inner world, and never be done discovering all there is to know about each other.
It’s exciting.It’s daunting. And it’s one of the greatest life adventures you can take.
Trust us, we know. We’ve been married a long time; more than 30 years for John and Julie,
and more than 25 years for Doug and Rachel, and we’re still discovering new things about each other,
still surprising each other, and more in love than we’ve ever been.
That doesn’t mean our relationships are perfect.
Sometimes we fight. Sometimes we’re rude or insensitive.
Perfection is not the price of love. Practice is.
We practice how to express our love and how to receive our partner’s love.
Love is an action even more than a feeling.
It requires intention and attention, a practice we call attunement.</p><p>成功的长期关系建立在微小的言辞、微小的姿态和微小的行为之上。
每一天你们在一起，都是在创造一生的爱。
了解你的伴侣不会在你们搬完家具、共用梳妆台抽屉空间或说出“我愿意”的那一刻结束。它永远不会结束。
你可以花一生的时间对伴侣的内心世界感到好奇，并勇敢地分享你自己的内心世界，但仍然无法完全了解彼此。
这是令人兴奋的。也是令人畏惧的。而且这是你可以追求的最伟大的生活冒险之一。
相信我们，我们知道。我们已经结婚很长时间了；约翰和朱莉已经超过30年，道格和瑞秋已经超过25年，我们仍然在彼此身上发现新事物，
仍然能互相带来惊喜，而且比以往任何时候都更加相爱。
这并不意味着我们的关系是完美的。
有时我们会争吵。有时我们会粗鲁或不敏感。
完美不是爱的代价。练习才是。
我们练习如何表达爱，如何接受伴侣的爱。
爱是一种行动，甚至比一种感觉更重要。
它需要意图和关注，这是我们称之为共鸣的一种实践方式。</p><p>And the big secret to creating a love that lasts and grows over time is simple.
Make dedicated, nonnegotiable time for each other a priority, and never stop being curious about your partner.
Don’t assume you know who they are today, just because you went to bed with them the night before.
In short, never stop asking questions. But ask the right kind of questions.</p><p>创造一个持久而成长的爱情的重要秘诀很简单。把专门、不可妥协的时间用于彼此，将其作为优先事项，永远对你的伴侣保持好奇心。
不要因为你昨晚与他们共度了一夜就认为你知道他们是谁。简而言之，永远不要停止提问，但要问出正确的问题。</p><p>We are not talking about yes-or-no kinds of questions.
The questions we are talking about are called “open-ended” questions.
These questions are invitations whose answers aren’t just a word or two.
They are how you generate intimate conversations that let your partner share what is really on their mind and in their heart.
These conversations will let you understand why your partner believes what they believe, does what they do,
and is who they are.
Open-ended questions lead to conversations that will make you fall in love,
or help you decide to make a long-term commitment,
or keep you in love with the person you have chosen to spend your life with.
This book will show you how to have the conversations that lead to intimacy, to awareness,
and to a deep and meaningful understanding of one another—the ways you’re the same and the ways you’re different.
This is what will allow you to be a relationship master, and not a disaster.
We’ve organized those conversations into the eight topics that matter most to relationships—trust and commitment,
conflict, sex, money, family, fun and adventure, growth and spirituality, and dreams.
We’ve structured these into eight dates for you to go on,
and provide step-by-step exercises and open-ended questions to ask one another on each date.</p><p>我们不是在谈论那种只能回答是或否的问题。我们所说的问题被称为“开放式问题”。这些问题是邀请，其答案不仅仅是一个或两个词。
它们是你促成亲密对话的方式，让你的伴侣分享他们心中真正的想法和感受。这些对话将让你了解为什么你的伴侣相信他们所相信的事情，
为什么他们会做他们所做的事情，以及他们是谁。开放式问题引导着能让你坠入爱河的对话，或者帮助你决定作出长期承诺，
或者让你与你选择共度一生的人保持相爱。本书将向你展示如何进行那些引领亲密、觉知和深入相互理解的对话——理解彼此的相似之处和不同之处。
这将使你成为一个处理感情的高手，而不是彻底失败的人。
我们将这些对话组织成了关系中最重要的八个主题——信任与承诺、冲突、性、金钱、家庭、乐趣与冒险、成长与灵性以及梦想。
我们将其划分为八次约会，为每个约会提供逐步的练习和开放式问题供你们相互询问。</p><p>These dates are a template, and yes, we want you to go on all eight dates,
but we also want you to make dating each other something that never ends.
We want you to be 95 years old and still going on a date—even if it’s just to the living room.
We don’t want you to ever stop exploring your partner and your relationship, your beliefs and your fears,
and your hopes and dreams for the future.</p><p>这些约会是一个模板，是的，我们希望您参加所有的八次约会，但我们也希望您使相互约会成为永不停止的事情。
我们希望您在95岁时仍然能够约会，即使只是在客厅里。我们不希望您停止探索您的伴侣和您的关系，您的信念和恐惧，以及您对未来的希望和梦想。</p><p>We don’t want you to ever stop talking with each other, and learning, and growing.</p><p>我们不希望你们停止相互交谈、学习和成长。</p><p>Decades of research show that the great relationships—the masters—are built on respect, empathy,
and a profound understanding of each other.
Relationships don’t last without talk, even for the strong and silent type.
This book will help you create your own love story by giving you the framework for the eight conversations
you and your partner should have before you commit to each other, or once you’ve committed to each other,
as well as throughout the years, whenever it is time to recommit.
That might happen when you have a baby, when one of you loses a job, during a health crisis,
or when the relationship has begun to feel stale.
Because this is for sure: Happily ever after doesn’t mean there are no challenges or conflict.
You can’t be in a relationship and not have conflict. Not if you’re doing it right.
Life always shows up with all its stresses and strains and crises, and how you manage these together can
ultimately make or break you (which we’ll explore more in the conflict date).
Happily ever after simply means that both partners are known, valued, accepted for who they are and who they are becoming.
The goal is to be able to love your partner more deeply each and every year you’re together.</p><p>数十年的研究表明，伟大的关系——即大师级的关系——是建立在彼此的尊重、共情和深刻理解的基础上的。
没有交流，即使是那种强壮而沉默的类型，关系也无法持久。这本书将通过为你和伴侣提供八个对话框架来创造你自己的爱情故事，
无论是在你和伴侣对彼此承诺之前、承诺之后，还是在多年之后，每当重新承诺的时刻到来时。
这可能发生在你们有了孩子时，其中一人失去了工作时，健康危机期间，或者当关系开始感到乏味时。
因为这是确定的：幸福到永远不意味着没有挑战或冲突。在一段关系中，你们不可能没有冲突。甚至你们全部做对了依旧无法避免。
生活总是带来各种压力、困难和危机，你们如何共同应对这些问题最终可能会让你们的关系变得更好或更糟（我们将在冲突的约会中更深入探讨这个问题）。
幸福到永远只意味着双方彼此了解、被重视、被接受为他们是谁以及他们正在成为谁。目标是在你们共度的每一年中，能够更深刻地爱着对方。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="never-too-early-or-too-late">NEVER TOO EARLY OR TOO LATE<a class="hash-link" href="#never-too-early-or-too-late" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>We wrote this book because very few couples receive guidance on how to create a lasting and loving relationship.
We met and became friends as part of a relationship education think tank—a consortium of experts in the fields of science,
psychology, and sexuality.It’s clear that most couples don’t get any training in relationships,
and often they don’t learn how to communicate with each other until they go to therapy, and that’s often too late.
We initially thought the book would be for couples who were just setting out on the path of committed relationship,
but when we asked for volunteers—couples who would be willing to test these eight dates and conversations—
we were surprised that couples at every stage of their relationship wanted to go on the eight dates.
Couples deciding whether to commit, couples who had just moved in together, recently engaged couples,
and newlywed couples all loved the dates, but so did couples who had been married for years and who wanted to
deepen an already great relationship or refresh a relationship that had lost some of its shine.
Life takes its toll on all relationships as careers, children, and crises can pull us away from each other.
The ideas behind these eight dates and the commitment to deep listening help us come back together.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="永远不嫌早也永远不嫌晚">永远不嫌早，也永远不嫌晚。<a class="hash-link" href="#永远不嫌早也永远不嫌晚" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>我们写这本书是因为很少有伴侣能获得关于如何建立持久和充满爱的关系的指导。
我们作为关系教育智囊团的一部分相识并成为朋友，该团体由科学、心理学和性学领域的专家组成。
很明显，大多数伴侣在关系方面没有接受任何培训，通常他们直到去接受治疗之前才学会如何与对方沟通，而那往往已经太晚了。
起初，我们认为这本书将是为那些刚开始走向承诺关系之路的伴侣而写的，但当我们征求志愿者——愿意测试这八次约会和对话的伴侣时，
我们惊讶地发现各个阶段的伴侣都希望参加这八次约会。正在决定是否承诺的伴侣、刚刚搬到一起的伴侣、最近订婚的伴侣和新婚伴侣都喜欢这些约会，
但那些已经结婚多年并希望加深已经很好的关系或者为一段失去光彩的关系注入新鲜感的夫妻也一样喜欢这些约会。
生活对所有的关系都有影响，因为事业、孩子和危机可能使我们相互疏远。这八次约会背后的理念和对深度倾听的承诺帮助我们重新走到一起。</p><p>If your relationship is new, and you’re wondering if this person you’re dating is “the one,”
we encourage you to take the time now to talk about the subjects that’ll ultimately determine your happiness (or misery) later.
And if they help you decide that you’re not right for each other, you’ll save yourselves years of heartache.
Or these dates may help you understand your differences and prevent conflict down the road over “perpetual problems”
and unchangeable differences.
And if you’re in a long-term relationship, these dates will help you have the conversations
that’ll strengthen your relationship and reduce conflict.
They may even help you get to know each other all over again, and return to those times
when you would stay up all night talking and couldn’t wait to learn more about each other.</p><p>如果你的关系是新的，你想知道你正在约会的这个人是否是“那个人”，我们鼓励你现在花时间谈论那些最终决定你们幸福（或不幸）的话题。
如果这些话题帮助你们确定彼此并不适合，你们将免去数年的心痛。
或者这些约会可以帮助你们理解彼此的差异，并避免日后因“永久性问题”和无法改变的差异而发生冲突。
如果你们已经处于长期关系中，这些约会将帮助你们进行对话，增进你们的关系并减少冲突。
它们甚至可以帮助你们重新认识对方，回到那些通宵聊天、迫不及待想要了解彼此更多的时光。</p><p>When it comes to romantic attraction, a recent study again revealed that
there is nothing we can measure about two separate individuals that can predict if they’ll like one another,
or be romantically attracted to one another.
This recent study, conducted by psychologist Samantha Joel of the University of Utah,
measured over 100 variables such as self-esteem, goals, values, loneliness, what they wanted in a partner, and so on.
Nothing predicted how they would feel after a short date.</p><p>当涉及到浪漫吸引力时，最近的一项研究再次表明，我们无法测量两个独立个体的任何因素来预测他们是否会相互喜欢或者彼此产生浪漫吸引力。
这项最近的研究由犹他大学的心理学家萨曼莎·乔尔进行，测量了100多个变量，如自尊心、目标、价值观、孤独感、他们对伴侣的要求等等。
在一次短暂的约会之后，没有任何因素可以预测他们会有怎样的感受。</p><p>This isn’t new information. All the algorithms for matching people are mostly worthless.
Why is that the case? Well, one explanation is offered by the classic German study by Claus Wedekind, called the T-shirt study.
Women smelled T-shirts worn by various men for two days and picked the ones they thought smelled the best.
Wedekind discovered that women preferred T-shirts of men who were the most genetically diverse from themselves
on the major histocompatibility complex of the immune system.
So, we’re definitely not looking for our clone.
We are, in fact, attracted to many kinds of people who are very different from ourselves.
In a 2006 study conducted at the University of New Mexico of 48 couples, women in couples more genetically diverse
from one another reported having a higher degree of sexual satisfaction,
while those women with similar genes reported having more fantasies about other men and were also more likely to cheat.
So, it turns out that all those algorithms for dating websites are no better than just pairing two strangers at random.</p><p>这并不是新的信息。所有用于匹配人们的算法大多毫无用处。为什么会这样呢？其中一个解释来自克劳斯·韦德金德的经典德国研究，被称为“T恤研究”。
女性嗅闻了各种男性穿了两天的T恤，并选择她们认为闻起来最好的那些。
韦德金德发现，女性更喜欢与自己在免疫系统的主要组织相容性复合物（MHC）上基因最为不同的男性的T恤。所以，我们绝对不是在寻找自己的克隆体。
实际上，我们对与自己非常不同的各种人都有吸引力。
在新墨西哥大学进行的一项于2006年的研究中，对48对伴侣进行调查发现，基因上差异更大的伴侣中的女性报告拥有更高程度的性满足，
而那些基因相似的女性则报告更多关于其他男性的幻想，并且更有可能出轨。所以，事实证明，所有那些用于约会网站的算法并不比随机匹配两个陌生人更好。</p><p>What’s the alternative? The answer is that we discovered that once two people interact together we can actually
predict if that relationship is destined to work out, or if it’ll be a source of continual misery.
So now we can offer you a set of eight guided conversations to have with a potential partner,
and, based on your feelings about these conversations, we can suggest if this relationship will be fulfilling or not,
and—if you’re committed to this person—what work the two of you need to do to make your love last.
As usual, we started with data. Couples volunteered to go on these dates and agreed to record their most intimate
conversations and upload the recordings to a secure site.
For the couples whose stories and conversations we share in this book, we have changed their identifying details
and kept them anonymous. The conversations in this book are brave and vulnerable conversations,
and we’re grateful for those couples who agreed to record and share their most intimate discussions.
The participants ranged in age from 21 to 67. Twenty-five percent of the couples were dating,
11 percent were in a committed relationship but not planning to marry,
32 percent were engaged or planning to marry, and 32 percent were married.
We collected hundreds of hours of recordings from heterosexual and same-sex couples while they were on their dates,
and we discussed the dates with many of them in follow-up webinar sessions.</p><p>替代方案是我们发现，一旦两个人互动起来，我们实际上可以预测这段关系是否注定会成功，或者是否会持续带来痛苦。
因此，我们现在可以为你提供一套八个引导性对话，让你和潜在伴侣进行，根据你对这些对话的感受，我们可以建议这段关系是否会充实，
以及如果你对这个人有承诺，你们两个需要做哪些工作来让你们的爱情持久。像往常一样，我们从数据入手。
伴侣们自愿参加这些约会，并同意记录他们最私密的对话并上传到一个安全的网站。对于我们在这本书中分享的伴侣的故事和对话，
我们已经修改了他们的身份细节并保持了匿名。这本书中的对话是勇敢而脆弱的对话，我们对那些同意记录和分享他们最私密讨论的伴侣表示感激。
参与者的年龄从21岁到67岁不等。25%的伴侣正在约会，11%的伴侣已经有了稳定的关系，但没有计划结婚，32%的伴侣订婚或计划结婚，32%的伴侣已经结婚。
我们在他们约会时收集了来自异性和同性伴侣的数百个小时的录音，并在后续的网络研讨会中与他们讨论了这些约会。</p><p>We all want to have a relationship that’s healthy and happy, intimate and passionate, and that lets us thrive
as individuals, as a couple and, for many, eventually as a family.
We want a partnership and a collaboration—to know that this other person will be there at our side
for all that life brings—the good and the bad. It’s never too early or too late to have these conversations.
These conversations will deepen your understanding of one another,
and the history and cultures you bring to your relationship.</p><p>我们都希望拥有一段健康、幸福、亲密、充满激情的关系，让我们作为个人、作为情侣以及对许多人来说，最终作为家庭的一部分得以茁壮成长。
我们渴望一种合作伙伴关系，要知道这个人将与我们并肩面对生活的一切——无论是好是坏。进行这些对话永远都不会太早或太晚。
这些对话将加深你对彼此的理解，以及你们带入关系中的历史和文化。</p><p>The conversations we’re going to be guiding you through aren’t all going to be easy.
Staying in love takes a level of vulnerability that isn’t always comfortable.
Some people have trouble talking about sex and intimacy. Others struggle to discuss growth and spirituality.
Some find it difficult to discuss money matters. You might worry: Will the conversations lead to a fight?
What if we don’t understand each other’s point of view? What if we have doubts about our differences?
All of this is okay. We’re going to teach you how to ask open-ended questions and really listen to each other’s answers.
We’ll give you clear guidelines about how to make the conversations creative and not combative.</p><p>我们将引导你进行的对话并不都容易。保持爱意需要一种并非总是舒适的示弱。有些人难以谈论性和亲密关系。
其他人在讨论成长和灵性方面遇到困难。有些人发现谈论金钱问题很困难。
你可能会担心：这些对话会引发争吵吗？如果我们不能理解对方的观点怎么办？如果我们对彼此的差异产生疑虑怎么办？这一切都没关系。
我们将教你如何提出开放性问题，并真正倾听彼此的答案。我们将为你提供明确的指导方针，让对话变得有创造性而非对抗性。</p><p>For newly committed couples, we want to emphasize that conflict will happen in any relationship,
but if you avoid conflict now, you’re guaranteed to have a lot more conflict later.
The early part of a relationship, besides the fun and infatuation, is about establishing trust and a shared future.
Inevitably there will be bumps in the road as you try to navigate two different lives, two different childhoods,
two different family histories. Listen and learn, share and invite. If you have an open heart and mind,
your dates will go much better, and your life together will, too.
As couples that have been married a long time, we know what it’s like to face issues that are difficult to discuss,
to fail to understand each other, even to question our marriages.
This is all normal, and by bravely tackling these conversations head-on,
you will enter into a marriage or relationship that’s strong and resilient.</p><p>对于刚刚承诺关系的情侣，我们要强调的是，任何一段关系中都会发生冲突，但如果你现在避免冲突，那么以后会有更多的冲突。
一段关系的早期阶段，除了充满乐趣和迷恋，还要建立信任和共同的未来。
在你试图协调两个不同的生活、两个不同的童年、两个不同的家庭历史时，难免会遇到一些波折。
倾听和学习，分享和邀请。如果你怀有开放的心态，你的约会将会更顺利，你们的生活也将如此。
作为已婚多年的夫妻，我们知道面对难以讨论的问题，难以理解对方，甚至对我们的婚姻产生质疑的感受。
这一切都是正常的，勇敢地直面这些对话，你将进入一段坚固而有韧性的婚姻或关系。</p><p>Here’s the news flash: Differences are the norm.
Ultimately, your differences can enrich the relationship if you can understand and accept them.
As you have these conversations, remember that most couples are more dissimilar than similar.
That’s okay. It’s not about finding your idealized mate, your other half, or your alter ego.
Our partners don’t always have to think like we think. That’s what makes life interesting—
it would be boring to be married to yourself. In fact, that’s called being single.</p><p>这里有一个重要的消息：差异是正常的。如果你能够理解和接受彼此的差异，最终这些差异可以丰富你们的关系。
在进行这些对话时，请记住大多数夫妻在许多方面都更加不同而非相似。这没关系。这并不是要找到理想化的伴侣、另一半或者替身。
我们的伴侣并不总是要和我们的想法一致。正是这样的差异让生活变得有趣，要是你只嫁给自己，那将会很无聊，实际上那就是单身。</p><p>Of course, many couples have core values that they share, but there are inevitably areas in which they’re different.
These differences attract us at first, and yet we can find ourselves in relationship trouble
when we try to change these differences later.
Learning to understand and accept the ways in which you’re different is key to creating lasting connection and enduring love.</p><p>当然，许多伴侣在核心价值观上是相似的，但不可避免地，在某些方面他们是不同的。这些差异一开始吸引着我们，但当我们试图改变这些差异时，
我们可能会在关系中遇到麻烦。学会理解和接受彼此的差异是创造持久的链接和长久的爱的关键。</p><p>One of the great gifts of relationship and marriage—and there are many—
is the ability to see the world through the eyes of another person, intimately, deeply, profoundly,
in a way we’re almost never able to do with another human being.
If you approach the mystery that is your partner with curiosity, your relationship and your life will be immeasurably enriched.</p><p>婚姻和恋爱关系中的伟大礼物之一（当然还有很多其他的）是能够以一种我们几乎无法与其他人做到的方式，亲密、深入、深刻地从另一个人的角度看待世界。
如果你怀着好奇心去探索你的伴侣，你的关系和生活将会得到无尽的丰富。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-science-of-love">THE SCIENCE OF LOVE<a class="hash-link" href="#the-science-of-love" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>About 45 years ago, John and his colleague Robert Levenson created a small laboratory at Indiana University
(and later at the University of Illinois, the University of Washington, UC Berkeley, and now the Gottman Institute in downtown Seattle).
At the University of Washington, John’s lab looked like a tiny studio apartment,
but it was actually an innovative research facility devoted to uncovering the truth about marriage and divorce.
Here are the fundamental research questions that John asked:
Can we predict who will get divorced and who will stay married, happily or unhappily?
And what actually makes relationships work well?</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="爱的科学">爱的科学<a class="hash-link" href="#爱的科学" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>大约45年前，约翰和他的同事罗伯特·莱文森在印第安纳大学（后来在伊利诺伊大学、华盛顿大学、加州大学伯克利分校以及现在的哥特曼研究所）建立了一个小型实验室。
在华盛顿大学，约翰的实验室看起来像一个小型单身公寓，但实际上它是一个致力于揭示婚姻和离婚真相的创新研究设施。
以下是约翰提出的基本研究问题：我们能否预测谁会离婚，谁会幸福或不幸福地维持在婚姻中？什么因素实际上能让关系良好运转？</p><p>For one of the lab’s major studies, 130 newlywed couples checked in to the apartment,
dubbed forever after as “The Love Lab,” so they could be studied around the clock as they went
about their day doing exactly what they would be doing if they were home—eating, watching television,
talking, listening to music, reading, cleaning, and so on.
It was all perfectly normal except there were three cameras mounted to the apartment walls that tracked their every move,
and each person wore a specially devised monitor that tracked their electrocardiogram physiology.
Plus every time they went to the bathroom, a sample was taken to check the amount of stress hormones in their urine.
John and his team of researchers studied each couple’s body language, monitored their vital signs,
and coded every facial expression (to a hundredth of a second).
The morning after a night in the Love Lab, the team took blood from the couple to check their hormonal and immune functioning.</p><p>在该实验室的一项重要研究中，有130对新婚夫妇入住了这个公寓，被称为“爱之实验室”，以便能够全天候地观察他们在日常生活中的各种活动，
就像他们在家中所做的一样——吃饭、看电视、聊天、听音乐、阅读、清洁等等。除了公寓墙上安装了三个摄像头跟踪他们的一举一动，
每个人都佩戴了一台特制的监测器用以跟踪他们的心电图生理指标外，一切都完美还原日常生活。
此外，每次他们上厕所时，都会取样检查尿液中的应激激素含量。
约翰和他的研究团队研究了每对夫妇的肢体语言，监测了他们的生命体征，并对每一个面部表情进行编码（频率高到到百分之一秒）。
在经历了一晚上的爱之实验室后的早晨，研究团队会从夫妇身上取血，检查他们的激素和免疫功能。</p><p>Another key part of their research in the lab was asking couples to tell the story of their relationship
during a two-hour oral history interview.
John asked how they first met and what their first impressions were of each other.
Then he asked them what they recalled about dating, how their relationship progressed,
and what they enjoyed doing together in the early stages of their relationship.
He asked them to reflect on how their relationship had changed over the years.
Hard times that they had been through were covered, too.</p><p>实验室中他们研究的另一个关键部分是要求夫妇在一次为期两小时的口述历史采访中讲述他们的恋爱故事。
约翰询问他们初次相遇的经过以及彼此的第一印象。然后，他询问他们对约会的回忆，他们的关系如何发展，以及他们在恋爱初期喜欢一起做什么。
他要求他们反思多年来他们的关系如何变化。采访还涵盖了他们经历的艰难时刻。</p><p>Looking back over the years, what moments stand out as the really hard times in your relationship?
What helped you stay together? How did you get through these difficult times?
What are your ideas about how to get through difficult times?</p><p>回顾多年的经历，有哪些在你们的关系中特别困难的时刻让你印象深刻？
是什么帮助你们继续在起？你们是如何度过这些困难时刻的？
对于如何度过困难时刻，你们有什么想法？</p><p>Then he asked the couple to explain how their relationship is different now from when they first met,
and other questions about how they chose to be together.</p><p>Of all the people in the world, what led you to decide that this was the person you wanted to marry (or commit to)?</p><p>Was it an easy decision or a difficult decision?</p><p>What was it like to fall in love?</p><p>然后，他请夫妇解释他们的关系现在与初次相遇时有何不同，以及他们是怎么选择在一起的其他问题。</p><p>在世界上所有的人中，是什么促使你决定和这个人结婚（或给予承诺）？</p><p>这是一个容易的决定还是一个困难的决定？</p><p>坠入爱河的感觉如何？</p><p>He also asked about the wedding or commitment ceremony, the honeymoon, their first year together,
what stood out as the really good times, and their idea of having fun together.
He and his colleagues also explored the couple’s beliefs about relationships.
They asked them to think of a couple they knew who had a good relationship,
and another couple whose relationship wasn’t so good, and what was different about these two relationships.</p><p>他还询问了婚礼或承诺仪式、蜜月、他们在一起的第一年，哪些时刻让他们感到非常愉快，以及他们对共同乐趣的看法。
他和他的同事们还探讨了夫妇对于关系的信念。他们让夫妇们想一想他们认识的一对关系良好的夫妇，以及一对关系不那么好的夫妇，这两对夫妇之间有何不同。</p><p>How would you compare your relationship to each of these couples?</p><p>How are your parents’ relationships similar and different from your own?</p><p>Then John asked them about the history of their relationship—its major turning points, ups and downs.
Finally, he asked them about how much they currently knew about their partner’s major worries, stresses, hopes, dreams, and aspirations.</p><p>How do you stay in touch with each other on a daily basis?</p><p>What are your routines for staying in emotional contact with one another?</p><p>你如何将你们的关系与这些夫妇进行比较？</p><p>你们的父母的关系与你们自己的关系有哪些相似之处和不同之处？</p><p>然后，约翰询问了他们关于他们关系的历史，包括重大转折点、起伏。最后，他询问了他们对伴侣的主要担忧、压力、希望、梦想和愿望的了解程度。</p><p>你们如何在日常生活中保持联系？</p><p>你们保持情感联系的日常例行事项是什么？</p><p>Meanwhile, throughout these discussions researchers monitored each person’s tone of voice, their words,
their gestures, and their positive and negative emotions.
Finally, John also asked each couple to discuss with each other a current conflict they were having
in their relationship while he just watched.</p><p>与此同时，在这些讨论过程中，研究人员监测每个人的语调、措辞、手势以及他们的积极和消极情绪。
最后，约翰还要求每对夫妇在他的旁观下讨论他们目前在关系中存在的冲突。</p><p>It was painstaking, methodical, and thorough research. The final result was the ability to determine
with 94 percent accuracy who would stay married and who would eventually divorce.
(After these results were published, John and Julie received far fewer invitations to dinner.)
Of the couples who stayed married, John was also able to predict the marriages that would be happy and
those that would be unhappy. John and Robert followed these and hundreds of other Love Lab couples for decades,
and in the end watched, recorded, and learned from over 3,000 relationships.</p><p>这项研究是费力、系统和全面的。最终的结果是能够以94%的准确率确定哪些夫妇会继续婚姻，哪些会最终离婚
（在这些结果发表后，约翰和朱莉收到的邀请晚餐的数量大大减少）。在那些维持婚姻的夫妇中，约翰还能够预测哪些婚姻会幸福，哪些会不幸福。
约翰和罗伯特在几十年的时间里追踪了这些以及其他数百对在“爱情实验室”进行观察的夫妇，并最终观察、记录并从超过3,000对夫妇的关系中汲取了经验教训。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="positive-or-negative">POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE<a class="hash-link" href="#positive-or-negative" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>After a decade of analyzing the data from the Love Lab, John discovered that one set of variables determined
whether a marriage would succeed or fail: Were the couples being positive or negative during the interview?
There was very little gray area. Either they emphasized their good times together and minimized the bad times,
or they emphasized their bad times together and minimized the good times.
Either they emphasized their partner’s positive traits and minimized their partner’s more annoying characteristics,
or they emphasized their partner’s negative traits and minimized their partner’s more positive characteristics.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="积极或消极">积极或消极<a class="hash-link" href="#积极或消极" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>经过十年的对爱情实验室数据的分析，约翰发现有一组变量决定了婚姻的成败：在面谈过程中，夫妻是表现出积极还是消极的态度？几乎没有中间地带。
他们要么强调他们在一起的美好时光，并淡化不好的时光；要么强调他们在一起的不好的时光，并淡化美好的时光。
他们要么强调伴侣的积极特质，并淡化伴侣更让人讨厌的特点；要么强调伴侣的消极特质，并淡化伴侣更积极的特点。</p><p>What we’ve learned is that the couples who are most likely to have happy marriages show the following qualities
and characteristics when they talk about their relationship:</p><p>我们所学到的是，最有可能拥有幸福婚姻的夫妻在谈论他们的关系时表现出以下的品质和特点：</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fondness-affection-admiration">FONDNESS, AFFECTION, ADMIRATION:<a class="hash-link" href="#fondness-affection-admiration" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Either verbally or nonverbally, the couple expresses positive affect (warmth, humor, affection);
they emphasize the good times; they compliment their partner.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-ness-versus-separateness">WE-NESS VERSUS SEPARATENESS:<a class="hash-link" href="#we-ness-versus-separateness" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>The couple emphasizes their ability to communicate well with each other and their mutual unity and togetherness.
They use words like “we,” “us,” or “our” as opposed to a lot of “I,” “me,” “mine.”
They don’t describe themselves as separate.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expansiveness-versus-withdrawal">EXPANSIVENESS VERSUS WITHDRAWAL:<a class="hash-link" href="#expansiveness-versus-withdrawal" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>The couple describes memories about their shared past vividly and distinctly,
versus vaguely or more generally with an inability to recall details.
They are positive and energetic talking about their relationship,
versus lacking energy and enthusiasm in recalling their past.
They express intimate information about themselves, rather than staying impersonal and guarded.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="glorifying-the-struggle">GLORIFYING THE STRUGGLE:<a class="hash-link" href="#glorifying-the-struggle" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>In a relationship people build a whole life together, filled with values, purpose, and meaning.
In “glorifying the struggle,” the couple expresses pride that they have survived difficult times,
versus expressing the hopelessness of their hard times. They emphasize their commitment to the relationship
versus questioning whether they should really be with this partner.
They are proud of their relationship versus being ashamed of it.
They talk about their shared values, goals, and life philosophy.
They have intentionally created a sense of shared meaning and purpose, even in the way they move through time together.
And they create intentional traditions in their relationship for connecting emotionally.
We call these “rituals of connection.” Dates are an example of rituals of connection.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="亲切深情和钦佩">亲切、深情和钦佩：<a class="hash-link" href="#亲切深情和钦佩" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>夫妻中的一方以言语或非言语方式表达积极情感（温暖、幽默、爱意），他们强调美好时光，称赞彼此。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="团结与统一">团结与统一：<a class="hash-link" href="#团结与统一" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>夫妻强调彼此之间的良好沟通能力，以及彼此的团结和凝聚力。他们使用“我们”、“我们的”等词汇，而不是过多使用“我”、“我自己”或“我的”。
他们不将自己描述为独立的个体。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="积极扩展与消极退缩">积极扩展与消极退缩：<a class="hash-link" href="#积极扩展与消极退缩" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>夫妻生动而清晰地描述他们共同的过去记忆，而不是模糊或笼统地回忆。在谈论他们的关系时，他们积极而有活力，而不是缺乏活力和热情。
他们表达了关于他们自己的亲密信息，而不是保持冷漠和戒备。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="崇尚奋斗">崇尚奋斗：<a class="hash-link" href="#崇尚奋斗" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>在一段关系中，人们共同建立了一个充满价值、目标和意义的生活。在“崇尚奋斗”中，夫妻表达对他们共度困难时期的自豪，而不是对困难时期的绝望感。
他们强调对关系的承诺，而不是质疑是否真的应该和这个伴侣在一起。他们为自己的关系感到自豪，而不是感到羞耻。他们谈论共同的价值观、目标和人生哲学。
他们有意识地在一起创造了一种共同的意义和目的，甚至在他们共同度过时间的方式上也是如此。他们在关系中创造了有意义的传统，以达到情感上的连接。
我们称这些为“连接的仪式”。约会就是连接仪式的一个例子。</p><p>If a couple starts by expressing negativity toward each other in the interview, whether in words, facial expressions,
or body language (cynicism, sarcasm, eye-rolling), then it signals that a negative switch has flipped,
and it almost inevitably predicts a relationship that will decline over time.
If the couple expresses disappointment in the relationship, feeling disillusioned,
as if marriage isn’t what they thought it would be, or if they are depressed, hopeless,
and bitter about their relationship, divorce is likely.
Mind you, negative events and regrettable incidents are inevitable in all relationships.
The positive switch is all about how couples positively interpret their negative events and their partner’s character,
and whether in their minds on an everyday basis they maximize the positive and minimize the negative
(in their partner and in their relationship).</p><p>如果一对夫妇在访谈中开始表达对彼此的负面情绪，无论是用言辞、面部表情还是肢体语言（愤世嫉俗、讽刺、翻白眼等），那么这表明一个负面开关已经打开，
几乎不可避免地预示着关系将随时间的推移而恶化。如果夫妻对关系感到失望，对婚姻感到幻灭，或者感到沮丧、绝望和对关系怀有怨恨，那么离婚的可能性很大。
要注意的是，在所有的关系中，负面事件和令人遗憾的事情是不可避免的。积极开关取决于夫妻如何积极地解释他们的负面事件和伴侣的品格，
以及他们是否在日常生活中最大化正面因素，最小化负面因素（无论是针对伴侣还是关系本身）。</p><p>What it boils down to is that an overall perceived negativity will quickly erode a relationship.
And every successful marriage and relationship has, at its foundation, a deep and close friendship—partners
who really know each other and are, at the heart of it, on the same side, part of the same team.
This is why the conversations in this book matter. The words you choose matter. Your tone of voice matters.
Even your facial expressions matter.</p><p>归根结底，总体上的消极情绪会迅速侵蚀一段关系。而每一段成功的婚姻和关系的基础，都是深厚而亲密的友谊——伴侣彼此真正了解，
并且从内心而言，站在同一边，是同一个团队的一部分。</p><p>Of course we all get it wrong sometimes. We miscommunicate, and when we do we need to make repairs.
Expecting no communication snafus in a relationship is like expecting a hole-in-one every time you hit a golf ball.
Happy relationships aren’t relationships where there is no fighting.
They are relationships where repairs are made after regrettable incidents happen—and where a couple connects
with each other day to day. Happy couples are not so very different from unhappy couples;
they are simply able to make repairs to their relationship easier and faster so they can get back to the joy of being together.</p><p>当然，我们都会在有的时做错事。我们会出现沟通失误，当发生这种情况时，我们需要进行修复。
期望在一段关系中没有沟通问题，就像期望每次击球都能一杆进洞一样。幸福的关系并不意味着没有争吵。
它们是在遗憾事件发生后进行修复，并且在日常生活中保持互相连接的关系。
幸福的伴侣并不与不幸的伴侣有太大的区别；他们只是能够更轻松、更快速地修复他们的关系，以便重新享受在一起的喜悦。</p><p>In the end, a big part of the success or failure of your relationship depends on the conversations
you have with each other. We sent over three hundred couples on the dates in this book.
They did the exercises, recorded their conversations, and shared their stories. New couples, celibate couples,
same-sex couples, and long-term married couples all found that these conversations brought them closer and
helped them see each other in new and exciting ways. They became better friends, and they fell in love all over again.</p><p>You can, too.</p><p>最终，你们的关系的成功与否在很大程度上取决于你们彼此之间的对话。我们为超过三百对伴侣提供了本书中的约会活动。他们完成了练习，
记录了他们的对话，并分享了他们的故事。新恋人、禁欲的伴侣、同性伴侣以及结婚很久的夫妻都发现这些对话使他们更加亲近，以新奇的方式看待对方。
他们成为了更好的朋友，重新坠入了爱河。</p><p>你们也可以做到。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-bigger-picture">THE BIGGER PICTURE<a class="hash-link" href="#the-bigger-picture" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="更广阔的视野">更广阔的视野<a class="hash-link" href="#更广阔的视野" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The quality of our closest relationships, more than any other factor, determines our physical health,
resistance to disease, and longevity.
Satisfying close relationships also improve various dimensions of each partner’s mental health.
Happy marriages or long-term relationships can significantly reduce depression, anxiety disorders, addictions,
and antisocial behavior, and reduce incidents of suicide.
In addition, many studies have shown that ongoing unhappy relationships can damage the cognitive and
emotional well-being of children, while happy relationships can strengthen children’s school performance,
peer relationships, and emotional intelligence.
Clearly, your relationship matters in your own lives, in the lives of your children, and in your larger community.</p><p>与任何其他因素相比，我们最亲密的关系的质量对我们的身体健康、抵抗疾病和寿命的影响最大。满足的亲密关系还能改善每个伴侣的各个方面的心理健康。
幸福的婚姻或长期的关系可以显著减少抑郁、焦虑症、成瘾和反社会行为，并减少自杀事件的发生。
此外，许多研究表明，持续不幸福的关系会损害儿童的认知和情绪幸福感，而幸福的关系可以增强儿童的学校表现、同伴关系和情商。
显然，你们的关系对你们自己的生活、孩子的生活以及更广泛的社区都很重要。</p><p>John and Julie have conducted scientific and clinical research and have practiced couples therapy for decades.

freak acts of nature—when the twin fates of childcare and work schedules align to give them a respite from
an endless “to-do” list. Date nights, however, shouldn’t be haphazard occurrences that happen only when opportunity,
finance, and laundry all reach some perfect and magical alignment in the universe. Date nights are planned.
Date nights are prioritized. In many relationships and marriages, fun, play, and connecting with
each other become the last items on the “to-do” list. This is a sure recipe for discontent and growing apart.</p><p>对于许多忙碌的伴侣，特别是有了孩子后，约会之夜往往变得零散、偶然的——当育儿和工作时间表的命运奇遇使他们得以喘息一下，摆脱无休止的“待办”清单。
然而，约会之夜不应该是仅在机会、财务和洗衣等一切完美和神奇的宇宙因素达到完美的对齐时才发生的偶然事件。约会之夜是计划好的。约会之夜是优先考虑的。
在许多关系和婚姻中，乐趣、玩耍和彼此的交流往往成为“待办”清单中的最后一项。这必将导致不满和疏离。</p><p>The plain and simple truth is—date nights make relationships.</p><p>坦率而简单地说，约会之夜让关系更美好。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-made-a-pact">WE MADE A PACT<a class="hash-link" href="#we-made-a-pact" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="我们达成了协议">我们达成了协议<a class="hash-link" href="#我们达成了协议" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Rachel and Doug have had date nights weekly since their very first date together 31 years ago.
That first date was during final exam week in college.
They knew right away they had to find a way to prioritize each other and what they knew was going to be
a life-changing relationship. “We made a pact immediately,” Doug explains, “that every night we would meet at midnight,
work done or not.
I had five 20-page papers to write that week, and Rachel was studying for her all-important pre-med finals.
But both of us were done each night before the clock struck midnight.
I’ve never worked faster or better or with a bigger smile on my face.</p><p>自从31年前他们第一次约会以来，Rachel和Doug每周都有固定的约会之夜。那次第一次约会是在大学期末考试周的时候。
他们立刻意识到他们必须找到一种方式来优先考虑对方和这段注定会改变他们生活的关系。
Doug解释说：“我们立刻达成了一个协议，每天晚上不论工作是否完成，我们都要在午夜相会。
那个星期我要写五篇20页的论文，而Rachel则在准备重要的医学预科期末考试。但每天晚上，我们两个人在午夜敲响前都完成了任务。
我从来没有像那个时候那样快速、高效地工作过，脸上也没有比那时更灿烂的笑容。”</p><p>“When we prioritized being together and gave our word to each other that our relationship would come first,
everything else that took so much time and seemed to make it impossible to find the time for a date just seemed to
contract and open up a window for being together. Even when Rachel was in medical residency working 110 hours a week,
even when we had newborn twins, even when I was working two jobs and commuting five hours a day round-trip,
we still found time for date night. It’s very unlikely we would have made it this far without date night.”</p><p>“当我们把在一起作为优先考虑并向对方保证我们的关系将排在第一位时，其他那些花费大量时间、看似无法找到约会时间的事情就似乎变得可以收缩，
为我们在一起开辟了一个窗口。即使Rachel在医学住院医师阶段每周工作110个小时，即使我们有新生儿双胞胎，即使我在工作两份工作、
每天通勤五个小时往返的日子里，我们仍然会找到时间进行约会之夜。如果没有约会之夜，我们很可能无法走到今天。”</p><p>TOO OFTEN, DATE NIGHT BECOMES A RANDOM, FREAK ACT OF NATURE.</p><p>太多时候，约会之夜成为了一种偶然而无法预测的事件。</p><p>Rachel agrees, “We would not be together if not for date night. I knew I wanted to be married for a long time.
So did Doug. And we somehow knew that date night was the key. The pact we made in college is still our pact today.
We pay attention to the relationship. Sometimes that has meant date night is a date day or a date morning,
but it’s always been our special time just to focus on each other. It hasn’t always been easy, but we always find a way.
Date night has saved our ass on many occasions.”</p><p>Rachel表示同意：“如果没有约会之夜，我们不会在一起。我很久以前就知道我想要长期婚姻。Doug也是如此。我们不知怎么地意识到，约会之夜是关键。
我们在大学时期达成的协议至今仍然有效。我们关注这段关系。有时候，约会之夜可能变成了一天或一早，但它始终是我们专门用来专注彼此的特殊时光。
这并不总是容易的，但我们总是找到方法。约会之夜在许多场合拯救了我们。”</p><p>For the purposes of this book, a date is a preplanned time where the two of you leave your work life and
your work-in-the-home life, and spend a set amount of time focusing on each other, and really talking and
listeningto each other. A date worth having is not the two of you sitting on the couch watching television together,
or going to a movie, or joining friends for a night of dancing.
It’s a special time set aside for just the two of you to connect.
Think of it as sacred time. Leave your electronics at home or turn them off and check only when the date is over.
And think of each of these eight dates as your first date. Plan them. Look forward to them. Get excited about them.
You can go to a movie or meet up with friends, too, but the main event of a date night is just time to be together
and to reconnect, to fall back in love and remind yourselves that there is more to your relationship than sharing
a home or coparenting children. You remind yourselves that you are first and foremost friends and lovers.</p><p>对于本书而言，约会是预先计划好的时间，在这段时间里，你们俩离开工作和家庭中的工作，花费一定的时间专注于对方，真正地相互交谈和倾听。
一个值得拥有的约会并不是你们两个人坐在沙发上一起看电视，或者去看电影，或者与朋友一起</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-to-get-personal">TIME TO GET PERSONAL<a class="hash-link" href="#time-to-get-personal" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="是时候私人交流了">是时候私人交流了<a class="hash-link" href="#是时候私人交流了" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>John and Julie, who work together daily, often in intense conversation, debate, and close collaboration,
particularly struggled with leaving their work behind on dates.
“If you work together, it can be especially tricky to separate what is a date and what is not a date.
And it’s tempting to talk about work when we go on dates,” Julie says.
“We write together, we design workshops together, we discuss therapeutic interventions for couples together.
We each passionately share our point of view.
We’ve had to very consciously separate out the professional from the personal.”</p><p>约翰和朱莉每天一起工作，经常进行密集的对话、辩论和紧密的合作，他们尤其在约会时很难摆脱工作的影响。
朱莉说：“如果你们在一起工作，将约会和非约会分开会特别棘手。而且我们在约会时很容易谈论工作。”
“我们一起写作，一起设计研讨会，一起讨论为夫妻治疗提供干预措施。我们都对自己的观点充满激情。我们必须有意识地将专业和个人分开。”</p><p>One of John and Julie’s favorite dates is to go to a local café. They order the same thing every time.
The waiters know them by name as well as their regular order of baked eggs, a baguette,
and jam—actually a double order of their homemade jam.
For Julie, the baguette is really a vehicle for delivering the jam. Within this familiar ritual,
they have made the conscious agreement not to discuss their work.
John says, “It’s our time to get personal, to ask open-ended questions, and to move away from our work-life.
We hold hands across the table, we flirt, and we laugh.”
It is this special time for communicating what’s in their hearts that makes going to this café a date.</p><p>约翰和朱莉最喜欢的约会之一是去当地的咖啡馆。他们每次都点同样的东西。服务员都知道他们的名字，也知道他们常点的烤鸡蛋、法棍面包和果酱，
实际上是双份自制果酱。对朱莉来说，法棍面包实际上是用来搭配果酱的。在这个熟悉的仪式中，他们自觉地约定不讨论工作。
约翰说：“这是我们私人交流的时间，我们可以提出开放式的问题，远离工作生活。我们手牵手坐在桌子对面，调情，开怀大笑。”
正是这个特殊的时刻，让他们去这家咖啡馆成为一次约会。</p><p>“We save our work debates for after the café. And it can take practice, whether you work together or apart,
to leave work behind and focus on the relationship during a date. But do it,”
says Julie. “It makes all the difference in the world.”</p><p>朱莉说：“我们把工作辩论留到离开咖啡馆之后。无论你们是否一起工作，离开工作专注于关系在约会中可能需要练习，但一定要做到。”
“这会产生世界上的巨大不同。”</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="date-night-obstacles">DATE NIGHT OBSTACLES<a class="hash-link" href="#date-night-obstacles" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="约会之夜的障碍">约会之夜的障碍<a class="hash-link" href="#约会之夜的障碍" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Some readers might be thinking, this sounds great and in a perfect world date nights are doable, but who has the time,

But a date night is more than an obligation—it’s a commitment to your relationship and to your hopes for a happy marriage.
It helps to carve out a specific and regular time each week and make this “appointment” a priority.
Unless someone is in the emergency room, make date night a “no matter what” event.
Set aside time like you would for a birthday, or church, or an anniversary, or any other special event
you celebrate in your life together. Date nights should be sacred times to honor your relationship.
Think of them as such, schedule them in your calendars for as much time as possible—even if it’s just for an hour,
suit up and show up, no matter what.</p><p>生活可能感觉非常忙碌，想要再为一个义务找到时间可能会让人感到不知所措。但约会之夜不仅仅是一种义务，它是对你们的关系和对美满婚姻希望的承诺。
最好每周都能找到特定而固定的时间，并将这个“约会”作为优先事项。除非有人在急诊室，要把约会之夜视为“不管发生什么”的事件。
像为生日、去教堂、纪念日或你们在一起庆祝的任何其他特殊事件那样安排时间。约会之夜应该是珍贵的时间，用来尊重你们的关系。
把它们看作这样的时间，并在你们的日历中安排尽可能多的时间，即使只有一个小时，无论如何要准备好出席。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="money">MONEY:<a class="hash-link" href="#money" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="金钱">金钱：<a class="hash-link" href="#金钱" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Dates don’t have to be expensive; in fact, they don’t have to cost anything at all. Pack a picnic, go for a walk,
sit in a park. There are endless ways to spend time together without breaking the bank. In each of the eight dates,
we make suggestions about where best to go on your date depending on the topic of conversation.
These are only suggestions. John and Julie used to have a cheap date by getting dressed up and going to
the beautiful Hotel Sorrento in Seattle, and pretending that they were hotel guests.
They would sit in the beautiful lobby in front of a fire and nurse one drink all evening.
They would answer each other’s open-ended questions for hours.</p><p>约会不一定要花费很多钱，事实上，它们不需要任何费用。准备一个野餐，去散步，坐在公园里。有无数种方式可以共度时光，而不会让钱包吃不消。

约翰和朱莉过去会打扮得漂漂亮亮，去西雅图的美丽索伦托酒店，假装自己是酒店的客人。
他们会坐在美丽的大厅里，面前有一把火，整个晚上只喝一杯酒。他们会彼此回答开放性的问题，谈论数小时。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="childcare">CHILDCARE:<a class="hash-link" href="#childcare" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="儿童照顾">儿童照顾：<a class="hash-link" href="#儿童照顾" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Childcare is often the stickler for couples who want to go on date nights but have young children at home.
Childcare does not have to be expensive or stressful. At times, both John and Julie, and Doug and Rachel,
would trade childcare with other couples, so both couples could enjoy date nights. If that’s not possible,
see if a trusted family member or close friend will help you in your quest to spend sacred time together.
Look for inexpensive babysitters in your neighborhood, or ask your friends for recommendations.
When their kids were young, Doug and Rachel routinely hired babysitters who could commit to multiple Saturday nights,
so that they didn’t have to scramble at the last minute to find childcare each week.
Some parents worry about leaving their children with other people,
but if you find a safe and reliable person to watch your children, you’re helping them learn that other people,
besides their parents, are trustworthy and reliable.
Children are incredibly resilient, and by showing your commitment to your relationship with your partner,
you’re nurturing your children by ensuring that they will be raised by parents in a healthy and stable relationship.
Children feed off of the love in a marriage.
Remember they are constantly modeling you, and you want them to see how you sustain a loving marriage.</p><p>对于有年幼子女的夫妻来说，儿童照顾经常是一个让他们想要进行约会之夜却束手无策的问题。儿童照顾并不一定昂贵或充满压力。
有时候，约翰和朱莉，以及道格和瑞秋，会与其他夫妻交换儿童照顾，这样两对夫妻都能享受约会之夜。
如果不可能的话，看看是否有值得信任的家人或亲密朋友愿意帮助你们共度珍贵时光。在你们的社区寻找价格合理的保姆，或者向朋友寻求推荐。
当他们的孩子还很小的时候，道格和瑞秋通常会雇佣那些可以在连续几个星期六晚上提供服务的保姆，这样他们不必在每周临时抓狂地寻找儿童照顾。
有些父母担心将孩子交给其他人照顾，但如果你找到一个安全可靠的人来照顾孩子，你们帮助孩子学会相信除了父母之外，还有其他值得信赖的人。
孩子们非常有适应能力，通过展示对伴侣关系的承诺，你们正在培养孩子，在一个健康稳定的关系中成长。孩子们从婚姻中的爱中获取营养。
记住他们在不断地以你们为榜样，你希望他们看到你们如何维持一段充满爱的婚姻关系。</p><p>See what makes the most sense in your life: Where there is a will there is always a way.

You may also want to each have a separate copy of the book and bring it with you on your date
so you can share any surprises or things that particularly resonated with you from the exercises
in each chapter that you’d like to discuss further with your partner.
You can also download the exercises and open-ended questions from the website, workman.com/eightdates.
On these dates you’ll be talking about what matters most, and really connecting with your partner,
so try to stay focused on the topics, exercises, and open-ended questions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="多聊天">多聊天：<a class="hash-link" href="#多聊天" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>带上与特定约会主题相关的开放性问题清单。这些问题将作为你们对话的指南和指南针。你们每个人可能还想分别拥有一本书，并在约会时带上它，
这样你们就可以分享任何意外或对你们特别有共鸣的事情，来自每章练习的事情，你想与伴侣进一步讨论。
你也可以从网站workman.com/eightdates下载练习和开放性问题。在这些约会中，你们将谈论最重要的事情，并真正与伴侣建立联系，
所以尽量专注于话题、练习和开放性问题。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="drink-little-or-not-at-all">DRINK LITTLE (OR NOT AT ALL):<a class="hash-link" href="#drink-little-or-not-at-all" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Limit your alcohol or drug consumption on date night. While you may think that alcohol relaxes inhibitions,
and it does, it also disinhibits aggression—not great for a date.
Many couples increase their chances of having a fight when they drink.
Try to have no more than the equivalent of one glass of wine on each date.
You want to be coherent and truly present for the intimate conversations you’re having.
If you want your dates mostly to take place at restaurants, make sure they are places where you can not only
speak to each other freely, but also hear each other clearly.
If it seems distracting to have important conversations at night or while eating and drinking,
then figure out another time that works for both of you.
Consider the morning—if you’re morning people!—or even taking an hour or more off from work, if schedules permit.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="少喝酒或者不喝">少喝酒（或者不喝）：<a class="hash-link" href="#少喝酒或者不喝" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>在约会之夜限制你的饮酒或吸毒。尽管你可能认为酒精会放松抑制力，的确如此，但它也会解除抑制力，对于约会来说并不是很好。
许多伴侣在喝酒时增加了争吵的机会。每次约会最多只喝一杯红酒的等量，不要超过这个限制。你希望在你进行亲密对话时保持清醒和真正的在场。
如果你希望大部分约会在餐厅进行，请确保它们是你们可以自由交谈并清楚地听到彼此的地方。如果在晚上或吃喝时进行重要对话似乎分散了注意力，
那么找出适合你们两个人的其他时间。考虑早晨（如果你们是早起的人！），甚至在工作中抽出一小时或更多的时间，如果时间允许。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keep-a-sense-of-humor">KEEP A SENSE OF HUMOR:<a class="hash-link" href="#keep-a-sense-of-humor" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>If you want the best for your relationship or you’re concerned about your relationship,
you’re doing the right thing by having the conversations in this book.
Yes, it’s serious and important work, but we also want you to have fun. Find the moments of humor.
Find the joy, even when it feels difficult. Don’t forget why you fell in love with each other, and most important,
don’t forget to laugh.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="保持幽默感">保持幽默感：<a class="hash-link" href="#保持幽默感" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>如果你想为你的关系争取最好的结果，或者你对你们的关系感到担忧，通过进行本书中的对话，你正在做正确的事情。
是的，这是严肃而重要的工作，但我们也希望你们能够享受其中的乐趣。
寻找幽默的时刻。找到快乐，即使感觉困难。不要忘记你们为什么相爱，最重要的是，不要忘记笑。</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-four-skills-of-intimate-conversation">The Four Skills of Intimate Conversation<a class="hash-link" href="#the-four-skills-of-intimate-conversation" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>he dates we are asking you to go on are ways to make time for each other, and also a space to have meaningful,

but these questions are only half of the equation. Listening is the all-important other half.
It requires a special kind of listening. It’s where we listen to understand, without judgment or defensiveness,
or the desire to rebut. It is an accepting form of listening. Listening is an action; you have to commit to it.
And you can’t do that if you don’t get out of your own head.
If you stay inside yourself, the voice you hear will be your own, and not your loved one’s.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="倾听的艺术">倾听的艺术<a class="hash-link" href="#倾听的艺术" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>为每个约会提供的问题具体且开放，但这些问题只是方程的一半。倾听是另一半的关键。它需要一种特殊的倾听方式。
这是我们用以理解的倾听，没有评判、防御或反驳的欲望。这是一种接纳的倾听形式。倾听是一种行动，你必须全身心地投入其中。
如果你无法走出自己的思维，就无法做到这一点。如果你一直停留在自我中，你听到的声音将是自己的声音，而不是你所爱的人的声音。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-attentive">BE ATTENTIVE:<a class="hash-link" href="#be-attentive" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Put away your smartphone, your tablet, and any other gadgets. Turn them off, or at the very least, silence them.
Show genuine interest and curiosity in what your partner is saying. Lean forward, make eye contact, and don’t interrupt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-present">BE PRESENT:<a class="hash-link" href="#be-present" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Conversation is about dialogue, so listening isn’t about just pressing the pause button on your monologue.
When you’re present as a listener, you don’t assume you know what your partner is going to say next,
and while your partner is speaking, avoid thinking about what you will say next, or preparing your rebuttal.
Instead, just LISTEN.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ask-questions">ASK QUESTIONS:<a class="hash-link" href="#ask-questions" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>If you don’t understand something, ask questions and then listen to the answers.
Remember it’s open-ended questions that open the heart. Do ask exploratory questions that help you understand,
such as, “Can you tell me more about that?” “Is there a story or memory related to that?” Also remember,
this isn’t an interrogation, it’s a conversation.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tune-in">TUNE IN:<a class="hash-link" href="#tune-in" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>It’s your job as a listener to tune in to your partner’s feelings. Make sure you don’t minimize your partner’s feelings
by dismissing them or trying to fix them. You don’t have to make your partner feel better or cheer him or her up.
Your only goal is simply to listen and to try to understand.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="witness">WITNESS:<a class="hash-link" href="#witness" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>A big part of listening is witnessing. This means you listen so your partner doesn’t feel so alone.
A powerful way to witness and to “be there” for your partner is to repeat back in your own words
what you have heard your partner saying, and thus communicate validation.
For example, if your partner has just described a problem with a friend, you can say,
“Sounds like you’re really upset with your friend and how she’s been so demanding and judgmental.
It makes total sense to me why you’d feel that way.”You don’t have to speak like a therapist.
You’re just letting your partner know they’ve been heard.
Funny thing is, our partner doesn’t actually know what’s going on in our head,
despite the fact that we often think they should. Share that you’ve heard your partner.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="avoid-judgment">AVOID JUDGMENT:<a class="hash-link" href="#avoid-judgment" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Don’t be critical and don’t give advice unless your partner asks for it.
In every conversation with our partner we want to communicate respect, understanding, and empathy.
The conversations we’re advocating for require a certain amount of vulnerability and openness,
in which each partner feels safe and free to share their innermost thoughts, feelings, and fears with the other.
Remember the goal in these conversations isn’t to prove that you’re right in your beliefs or that your partner is wrong.
The goal is to understand the similarities and differences that you have and to create empathy for
why you each see the world the way that you do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="magnify-acceptance">MAGNIFY ACCEPTANCE:<a class="hash-link" href="#magnify-acceptance" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>In these conversations you’ll be going deeper into understanding one another,
and that takes a high level of vulnerability. Try to understand what makes your partner tick,
and work to accept the way your partner is, cherishing what you have, and building gratitude for one another.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="注意力集中">注意力集中：<a class="hash-link" href="#注意力集中" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>将你的智能手机、平板电脑和其他设备放在一边。关掉它们，或者至少将其静音。展现对伴侣所说的内容的真正兴趣和好奇心。
身体前倾，保持眼神交流，不要打断对方。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="当下的存在">当下的存在：<a class="hash-link" href="#当下的存在" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>对话是双方的交流，所以倾听不仅仅是按下你的独白的暂停按钮。当你作为倾听者存在时，你不会假设你知道伴侣接下来要说什么，而在伴侣发言时，
避免思考下一步要说什么，或者准备反驳。相反，只是倾听。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="提问">提问：<a class="hash-link" href="#提问" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>如果你不明白某件事，提问然后倾听答案。记住，开放式问题打开心扉。询问帮助你理解的探索性问题，例如：“你能告诉我更多关于这个的吗？”
“与此相关的有什么故事或记忆吗？”同时记住，这不是审问，而是对话。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="调整注意力">调整注意力：<a class="hash-link" href="#调整注意力" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>作为倾听者，你的任务是调整注意力到伴侣的情感上。确保不要通过忽视或试图解决它们来贬低伴侣的情感。你不必让伴侣感觉更好或鼓励他们。
你的唯一目标就是倾听并尽力理解。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="见证">见证：<a class="hash-link" href="#见证" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>倾听的一个重要部分是见证。这意味着你倾听，使你的伴侣不感到孤单。见证和“在那里”为你的伴侣的一种有力方式是用自己的话重复回应你听到的伴侣所说的，
从而传达认可。例如，如果你的伴侣刚刚描述了与朋友的问题，你可以说：“听起来你对你的朋友感到非常沮丧，因为她一直那么苛刻和判断。
我完全理解你会有那样的感觉。”你不必像治疗师那样说话。你只是让你的伴侣知道他们被听到了。有趣的是，我们的伴侣实际上并不知道我们的内心在想些什么，
尽管我们经常认为他们应该知道。告诉他们你已经听到了你的伴侣。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="避免评判">避免评判：<a class="hash-link" href="#避免评判" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>不要批评，除非伴侣要求意见。在与伴侣的每一次对话中，我们希望传达出尊重、理解和共情。我们提倡的对话需要一定程度的脆弱和开放，在这种对话中，
每个伴侣都感到安全和自由，可以与对方分享他们最内心的思想、感情和恐惧。记住，在这些对话中的目标不是证明你在信念上是正确的，或者你的伴侣是错的。
目标是理解你们之间的相似之处和差异，并对为什么你们每个人看待世界的方式产生共情。</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="放大接纳">放大接纳：<a class="hash-link" href="#放大接纳" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>在这些对话中，你将更深入地了解彼此，这需要高度的脆弱性。努力理解你的伴侣是如何运作的，并努力接受伴侣的方式，珍惜你们所拥有的，并对彼此心存感激。</p><p>Listening doesn’t always come easy for us, but without listening, intimate conversation is impossible.
There are questions you can ask as you listen to each other that’ll help guide you on your dates and in your relationship.
Eventually they’ll become second nature. Here are some fail-safe questions that can help you understand your partner.</p><p>What are you feeling?</p><p>What do you need?</p><p>What are your choices?</p><p>How can I help?</p><p>What’s your worst-case scenario in this situation?</p><p>What’s your ideal dream for the situation?</p><p>If you find you’re not understanding each other, but rather heading toward conflict,
take a deep breath (counting to ten really does help because it calms down the emotional centers of the brain) or
take a bathroom break. These dates aren’t about processing disagreements or “working” on your areas of conflict.
We have included a “Troubleshooting” section for each date with some do’s and don’ts, so that you don’t create conflict.
If you find things are getting hot and heavy (and not in a good way), please see “Fight Fair and Repair,”
on page 81. You can also find additional resources for addressing conflict or finding a therapist
at the Gottman Institute website, gottman.com,</p><p>This is important work, and we know that by taking this journey together and having these eight conversations

Getting started is 50 percent of the job, so your journey to a lifetime of love has already begun.</p><p>倾听并不总是容易的，但如果没有倾听，亲密的对话是不可能的。在你们相互倾听时，有一些问题可以帮助你们在约会和关系中指导你们。
最终，这些问题会变得自然而然。下面是一些万无一失的问题，可以帮助你了解你的伴侣。</p><p>你现在感觉如何？</p><p>你需要什么？</p><p>你有哪些选择？</p><p>我可以如何帮助你？</p><p>在这种情况下，你最糟糕的情景是什么？</p><p>对于这种情况，你的理想梦想是什么？</p><p>如果你发现彼此不理解，而是朝着冲突的方向发展，请深呼吸（数到十确实有帮助，因为它平静了大脑的情绪中心）或者上个洗手间休息一下。

如果你发现情况变得激烈和紧张（不是好的方式），请参考第81页的“公平战斗和修复”。
你也可以在Gottman研究所的网站gottman.com上找到解决冲突或寻找治疗师的其他资源。</p><p>这是一项重要的工作，我们知道通过一起踏上这个旅程并进行这八次对话，你们的友谊和爱情将会成长，你们将以稳固的基础开始你们的生活。

Every time he walked out of his Intro to Astronomy class,
she was sitting on the steps outside waiting to go into her next class. He couldn’t help but notice her.
“She always had her head in a book. She never looked at me once. If she had, I would have said hello,
but she was always reading. This went on for five weeks.
I knew everything there was to know about the top of her head and her shoes, but that’s it.
I didn’t even really know what she looked like or what color her eyes were, but she drew me in.
The way she could focus, the way she was always there, it made me so curious about her.
She became a regular part of my week, but she had no idea I even existed.
I tried bumping into her once as I went down the steps, just a slight jostle, a
nd even then she just mumbled ‘it’s okay’ when I apologized, and didn’t look up.</p><p>依靠我</p><p>信任和承诺</p><p>本和莉娅在亚利桑那大学的校园上相遇。每当他走出“天文学入门”课堂时，她总是坐在外面的台阶上等着上下节课。他不由自主地注意到她。
“她总是埋头在书里。她从来没有看过我一眼。如果她看过我，我会打个招呼，但她总是在读书。这持续了五个星期。我知道她头顶和鞋子的所有细节，但仅此而已。
我甚至不知道她长什么样子，她的眼睛是什么颜色，但她吸引了我。她的专注力，她总是在那里，让我对她感到好奇。
她成为我每周的固定部分，但她甚至不知道我存在。
有一次，当我走下台阶时，我试图故意碰到她，只是轻轻地碰了一下，她道歉时只是嘟哝着‘没关系’，并没有抬头。</p><p>“I kept thinking about her. Not just on the days I had that class, but every day.
Who was she? What was her name? What was she reading?”</p><p>One day Ben just decided enough was enough and when class let out, he sat down on the steps next to her.</p><p>“He sat really close, too close, like our shoulders were actually touching,” said Leah.
“I was reading Sartre for my philosophy class. It was dense. Philosophy is no joke and I was struggling.
I was annoyed at first, and I lifted my head up and there he was with the biggest smile on his face,
like we were long-lost friends or something.”</p><p>Ben remembers the look on Leah’s face. “I was just so happy to see her whole face and her big brown eyes,
that I completely forgot I was a stranger to her.
She wasn’t a stranger to me, but she definitely looked annoyed at first.”</p><p>Ben finally introduced himself and asked her what she was reading. “I didn’t want to blow my chance to talk to her,
so I kept asking her questions. I didn’t really give her a chance to end the conversation.
She doesn’t have a rude bone in her body, lucky for me,
so we talked for about twenty minutes until she had to go to class.”</p><p>“For the rest of the semester, before every class, we talked for twenty minutes,” said Leah.
“Just talked. About everything. He never asked me out, he never asked for my number,
he just sat on those steps and asked about my life. It was kind of weird now that I think about it.
Finally I asked him out on a date. I think I shocked him.”</p><p>“She definitely startled me, but of course I said yes, and here’s the thing, I was already in love with her before our first date, before our first kiss, before anything physical.”</p><p>“He was just steady. He was always there. Always smiling and asking me questions about my life. One day he noticed I was cold and he gave me his sweatshirt, and then didn’t ask for it back before he left. I can’t explain it, but that little thing made me trust him. He made me feel safe in this weird way I didn’t know I wanted to feel safe in. And it’s been that way ever since. We’ve been together now almost five years, we’re planning on getting married, and I don’t think I’ve ever trusted anyone more in my life. And it all has to do with those conversations on the steps. He always showed up for me and he still always shows up for me and he notices when I need something, even sometimes before I consciously know what I need. He’s my best friend and the love of my life.”</p><p>“我一直在想她。不仅仅是在我上那门课的那几天，而是每天都在想。她是谁？她叫什么名字？她在读什么书？”</p><p>一天，本突然下定决心，在下课后他坐在她旁边的台阶上。</p><p>“他坐得很近，太近了，就像我们的肩膀实际上触碰在一起一样，”莉娅说。“我正在为我的哲学课读萨特。那是很艰深的。哲学可不是开玩笑的，我很苦恼。
起初我很恼火，抬起头来，他脸上露出了最灿烂的微笑，就像我们是失散多年的朋友一样。”</p><p>本记得莉娅脸上的表情。“我只是很高兴看到她的整张脸和她的大棕色眼睛，我完全忘记了我对她来说是一个陌生人。她对我来说不是陌生人，但起初她明显有些生气。”</p><p>本最终向她介绍了自己，并问她在读什么书。“我不想错过和她交谈的机会，所以我不停地问她问题。我没有给她结束对话的机会。
她体贴善良，对我来说是幸运的，所以我们聊了大约二十分钟，直到她去上课。”</p><p>“在整个学期剩下的时间里，每节课前，我们都会聊上二十分钟，”莉娅说。“只是聊天。关于一切。他从来没有约我出去，从来没有要我的电话号码，
他只是坐在那些台阶上，问我关于我的生活的问题。现在想想，这有点奇怪。最后，我邀请他约会。我想我把他吓到了。”</p><p>“她确实吓到我了，但当然我答应了。这里有一件事，我在我们第一次约会之前，第一次接吻之前，甚至第一次身体接触之前，我已经爱上她了。”</p><p>“他很稳定。他总是在那里。总是微笑着问我关于我的生活的问题。有一天他注意到我很冷，他给了我他的卫衣，然后离开之前没有要回来。
我无法解释，但这件小事让我信任他。以一种我不知道自己想要感受安全的奇怪方式，他让我感到安全。
从那以后一直都是这样。我们已经在一起将近五年了，我们计划结婚，我觉得在我的生活中从未有过比他更值得信任的人。
这一切都与那些在台阶上的对话有关。他总是为我出现，他仍然总是为我出现，他会注意到我需要什么，有时甚至在我有意识之前。
他是我的最好朋友和我生命中的爱人。”</p><p>When Ben and Leah went on the Trust &amp; Commitment Date, they discovered they had very different experiences of
what commitment looked like in their families growing up.
Leah explained that for her, trust is about feeling safe and about how attentive Ben is.
“My parents were divorced and my mom was kind of a wreck emotionally.
She didn’t really pay attention to me or interact. She was tired all the time.
She didn’t have the bandwidth to take care of me emotionally.
I was devastated when I didn’t make the cheerleading team, and she was nowhere to be found.
It sounds minor, but it hurt. My dad wasn’t around either. Books were my comfort.
I just lost myself in books. So I guess trust for me is about follow-through and paying attention.
Do you do what you say you are going to do?”</p><p>当本和莉娅进行了信任和承诺的约会时，他们发现在他们成长的家庭中，对承诺的理解有很大的不同。莉娅解释说，对她来说，信任是关于感到安全，
关于本的关心。“我的父母离婚了，我的妈妈在情感上有点混乱。她并没有真正关注我或与我互动。她总是很累。她没有能力在情感上照顾我。
当我没有进入拉拉队时，我感到非常沮丧，而她无处可寻。听起来很微小，但是这伤害了我。我的爸爸也不在身边。书是我的安慰。
我只是沉迷于书中。所以我想，对我来说，信任是关于坚持和关注。你会做你说你要做的事吗？”</p><p>Ben’s parents never divorced, but their commitment was all about their belief that God meant for them to be together.
“They were together and our family was together, but I wouldn’t ever see them spending lots of alone time with each other.
Everything revolved around the kids, and going to church, and their routine.
I remember watching them not talking to each other, and thinking I’m never going to be like that.
They were faithful sexually,” Ben added, “but I don’t know how committed they really were to each other
as people if you know what I mean. I did see my dad checking out other women at times, and that was strange.”</p><p>本的父母从未离婚，但他们的承诺完全是基于他们相信上帝注定他们应该在一起。“他们在一起，我们的家庭在一起，但我从来没有看到他们花很多独处时间。
一切都围绕着孩子、去教堂和他们的日常生活。我记得看着他们不跟对方说话，我想我永远不会变成那样。
他们在性方面忠诚，”本补充道，“但我不知道他们对彼此作为人的承诺有多深。我确实见过我爸爸偶尔看其他女人，那感觉很奇怪。”</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ben-and-leah-discovered-they-had-very-different-experiences-of-what-commitment-looked-like">BEN AND LEAH DISCOVERED THEY HAD VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF WHAT COMMITMENT LOOKED LIKE.<a class="hash-link" href="#ben-and-leah-discovered-they-had-very-different-experiences-of-what-commitment-looked-like" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Ben found it enlightening to go on the trust date. “I never knew about the cheerleading team, but it makes sense.
I know how important it is that I show up when I say I am going to, and once I had to break plans we had to go camping,
and now her reaction makes sense to me.”</p><p>“I didn’t react well,” laughed Leah. “But we both realized after having this conversation how much more trust
is about than just not cheating on each other, which is the simple way to think about commitment and trust.
It’s just giving your word on something—whether it’s a big something or a little something—and being true to it.”</p><p>“And she never did give me my sweatshirt back.”</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="本和莉娅发现他们对于承诺的理解有着非常不同的经历">本和莉娅发现他们对于承诺的理解有着非常不同的经历。<a class="hash-link" href="#本和莉娅发现他们对于承诺的理解有着非常不同的经历" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h5><p>Ben发现参加信任约会是很有启发的。“我从来不知道她没进入拉拉队，但这很有道理。我知道当我说我会做某事时出现的重要性，
有一次我不得不取消我们去野营的计划，现在她的反应对我来说是有道理的。”</p><p>“我当时的反应不好，”莉娅笑着说。“但我们在这次对话之后都意识到，信任远不仅仅是不对彼此出轨，这只是关于承诺和信任的简单思考方式。
它只是对某件事情发表意见，并忠于它。”</p><p>“而她从来没有把我的卫衣还给我。”</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="choosing-commitment">CHOOSING COMMITMENT<a class="hash-link" href="#choosing-commitment" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>In a relationship, commitment is a choice we make every single day, over and over again.
We choose it even when we are tired and overworked and stressed out.
We choose it no matter what attractive person crosses our path.
We also choose it every time our partner makes a bid for attention and we put down our book,
or look away from the television, or up from our smartphone, or stop whatever it is we’re occupied with to
acknowledge their importance in our life. This acknowledgement may call for just a smile or for a conversation,
but whatever it calls for, we authentically try to deliver.
When we make our relationship a priority by showingthat it’s a priority,
we build trust and demonstrate our loyalty far beyond any words we say in our wedding vows.
What the Love Lab found is that it is the small, positive things done often that make the most difference
and build that cocoon of trust and safety in our relationships.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="选择承诺">选择承诺<a class="hash-link" href="#选择承诺" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>在一段关系中，承诺是我们每一天都要不断作出的选择。即使我们感到疲倦、过度工作和压力重重，我们仍然选择承诺。
无论有多么有吸引力的人出现在我们面前，我们也选择坚守承诺。每当我们的伴侣寻求关注时，我们放下手头的书籍，从电视上移开目光，离开手机，
或停下正在做的事情，以承认他们在我们生活中的重要性。这种承认可能只需要一个微笑，或者一次对话，但不管需要什么，我们都真诚地努力去做到。
当我们把我们的关系置于优先位置，并展示它的重要性时，我们建立了信任，展示了我们的忠诚，远超过我们在婚誓中所说的任何话语。
爱的实验室发现，经常做一些小的积极的事情对于关系产生最大的影响，构建了我们关系中的信任和安全的保护圈。</p><p>So what does true commitment mean? The most obvious meaning is that we resist possibilities with other people.
We’re faithful sexually and faithful emotionally to our partner.
We maintain boundaries in our relationships outside the marriage.
The late Dr. Shirley Glass, one of the world’s leading experts on infidelity, wrote a book entitled Not “Just Friends.”
Her expertise really boils down to windows and walls. When you’re married or otherwise committed to a partner,
ideally what you do is create a wall around the two of you with an open window between you.</p><p>那么真正的承诺意味着什么呢？最明显的意思是我们抵制与其他人的可能性。在性上和情感上，我们对伴侣保持忠诚。我们在婚姻以外的关系中保持边界。
已故的著名不忠专家谢丽·格拉斯博士在她的著作《不仅仅是朋友》中提到了窗户和墙壁。当你与伴侣结婚或建立其他承诺关系时，
理想情况下你所做的是在你们之间建立一堵墙，并在中间留有一个敞开的窗户。</p><p>This wall around the two of you separates you from others in terms of your deepest emotional and physical connections.
What Dr. Glass found in her research is that when people, especially people who are unhappy in their relationships,
start confiding in another person about their relationship, they are opening up a window to this outside person.
And when they keep this new platonic or emotional relationship secret from their partner,
they start building a wall between themselves and their primary partner.
There can’t be walls between you if you’re going to have long-term and lasting trust, commitment, and loyalty.
And windows to a close friend (whether of the opposite sex or the same sex) outside your relationship
can quickly become doorways, and that’s when affairs happen. It’s not impossible to have friends like this,
but you have to be aware of your boundaries, and it’s a huge red flag if one of you starts keeping secrets
from your partner about any new friendship. Then you are building a wall between you that disrupts your commitment
to one another.</p><p>这种围绕着你们两个的墙壁将你们与他人在最深层的情感和肉体联系上分隔开来。
格拉斯博士在她的研究中发现，当人们，尤其是那些对他们的关系感到不满意的人，开始向其他人倾诉他们的关系问题时，他们就打开了与外界人士的窗户。
而当他们将这种新的纯友谊或情感关系对伴侣保密时，他们就在自己与主要伴侣之间建立起了一道墙壁。
如果你们要建立长期和持久的信任、承诺和忠诚，就不能在你们之间存在隔阂。
而与关系亲密的朋友（无论是异性还是同性）在你们关系之外，很快就可能成为通往不忠的门户。
拥有这样的朋友并不是不可能，但你必须意识到自己的界限，如果你们中的任何一方开始对新的友谊对伴侣保密，那么这将是一个巨大的警告信号。
这样你们之间就会建立起一道墙壁，破坏了你们对彼此的承诺。</p><p>There is no question that committing to a person can be a terrifying prospect.
It means putting all our eggs in one basket.
There will be no one waiting in the wings if this relationship doesn’t work out. There isn’t a safety net.
If things aren’t going well, we go to no one else to complain.
Instead we need to go directly to our partner to work things out.
Also, if we’re committed, we have given this person everything we have to offer.
There’s nothing left over for another lover. That’s a risky decision, but it’s essential.
Without this level of commitment, love will not last.</p><p>毫无疑问，对一个人做出承诺可能是一种令人恐惧的前景。这意味着我们要把所有的蛋放在一个篮子里。如果这段关系不起作用，就没有其他人在翅膀下等待。
没有安全网。如果事情进行得不顺利，我们不能去向别人抱怨。相反，我们需要直接与我们的伴侣沟通解决问题。
此外，如果我们承诺了，就意味着我们已经把我们所能提供的一切都给了这个人。没有剩下的东西给另一个情人。这是一个冒险的决定，但它是必要的。
如果没有这种程度的承诺，爱情将无法持久。</p><p>Choosing commitment means accepting your partner exactly as he or she is, despite their flaws.
It means never threatening to leave, even if at times you might want to.
It also means caring about your partner’s pain as much as—if not more than—your own.
As John so aptly puts it, “If my wife is in pain, my world stops so I can listen to her.”
In a committed relationship, you will both stop the world to try to understand and ease each other’s pain.
This is partly why we get married, and this is partly why we love.
We need each other and we need to be needed by each other.
True commitment is choosing each other over and over again,
because ultimately what makes relationships work is the decision to make them work.</p><p>选择承诺意味着接受你的伴侣的全部，包括他们的缺点。即使有时候你可能想离开，也意味着永远不会威胁要离开。
它还意味着关心你伴侣的痛苦，甚至比你自己的痛苦更多。正如约翰所形容的那样，“如果我的妻子痛苦，我的世界就停止下来，我会倾听她。”
在一段承诺的关系中，你们将共同努力停下脚步，试图理解和减轻彼此的痛苦。这部分是我们结婚的原因，也是我们爱的原因。我们彼此需要，也需要被对方需要。
真正的承诺是一次又一次地选择彼此，因为最终使关系持续运作的是决定让它们持续运作。</p><p>There is one step that cascades toward all betrayals.
It often happens when things aren’t going well in the relationship.
That step is making negative comparisons of our partner with other real or imagined alternative relationship partners.
We call these “Negative Comps.” Rather than nurturing gratitude for what we have with our partner,
we nurture resentment for what’s missing. When something is bothering us about our partner,
rather than talking this over to get our needs met within the relationship,
we fantasize about another relationship and how we might receive what is missing from our current relationship
with this fantasy partner.
These Negative Comps become a dangerous way of dealing with our negative feelings within the relationship.</p><p>有一种行为会引发一系列的背叛。通常发生在关系不顺利的时候。这个行为就是与其他现实或想象中的替代伴侣进行负面比较。我们称之为“负面比较”。
与其培养对伴侣所拥有的感激之情，我们培养对所缺失之物的怨恨。
当我们对伴侣有所不满时，与其通过交流满足我们在关系中的需求，我们会幻想另一种关系，以及如何通过与这个幻想伴侣在现有关系中所缺失的方面进行补充。
这种负面比较成为了我们处理关系中负面情绪的一种危险方式。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jumping-in-with-two-feet">JUMPING IN WITH TWO FEET<a class="hash-link" href="#jumping-in-with-two-feet" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Many years ago, John had been working with a couple for several weeks.
One night, when they showed up at their appointed time, the couple made it clear that they were “done.”
John was the sixth therapist the couple had been to, and as far as they were concerned,
therapy was failing and it was time to break up with John as their therapist,
and perhaps time to break up with each other as well.
John was surprised and sorry the couple had decided to quit—he had thought their case was going well
and everyone was making progress.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="两脚跳入">两脚跳入<a class="hash-link" href="#两脚跳入" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>很多年前，John与一对夫妇一起工作了几个星期。有一天晚上，当他们按约定时间出现时，这对夫妇明确表示他们“结束了”。
John是这对夫妇见过的第六位治疗师，对他们来说，治疗失败了，现在是时候结束与John的治疗了，也许还是该结束他们自己的关系。
John感到惊讶和遗憾，这对夫妇决定放弃治疗，因为他本以为他们的病例进展顺利，每个人都在取得进步。</p><p>“Could you do me a favor?” asked John. “Since you’ve already paid for this session,
would you be willing to stay and help me understand why my therapy has failed for you? As a therapist,
I have a commitment to myself to grow from my failures.”</p><p>The couple agreed to stay. John asked them what their week had been like.</p><p>“We had a huge argument   .  .  .” the woman began, but then her husband interrupted her to continue the story.</p><p>“We went to a party and I was in the middle of a great conversation with a woman I met there,
and then my wife taps me on the shoulder like she always does, and said she was tired and wanted to go home and go to bed.”</p><p>John nodded. He had heard this couple fight tooth and nail negotiating agreements between them.
He was a successful businessman, while she was a therapist who had all but given up her practice
to stay home with their children, and their struggle was always about time, money, and ultimately,
who held the power to call the shots.
John asked them to explain more about what happened at the party that led them to deciding to end therapy.</p><p>“Well,” the man said, “She was tired and wanted to leave, so on the car ride home I told her that I had found
the woman at the party really attractive and had really enjoyed talking to her.”
John didn’t respond as the man recalled that he told his wife that they never talked like that anymore,
and he was turned on by the woman at the party because she was flirting with him and his wife hadn’t flirted
with him in a long time.</p><p>“And what did you say to that?” John asked the woman.</p><p>“I got angry and told him to grow up and stop flirting with other women.”</p><p>“And what were you thinking?”</p><p>“你能帮个忙吗？”John问道。“既然你们已经支付了这次疗程的费用，你们愿意留下来帮我理解为什么我的治疗对你们来说失败了吗？
作为一名治疗师，我对自己有一个成长的承诺，要从失败中成长。”</p><p>这对夫妇同意留下来。John问他们这一周过得怎么样。</p><p>“我们有一次激烈的争吵……”女人开始说，但她的丈夫打断她继续讲故事。</p><p>“我们去参加了一个派对，我正在与一个我在那里认识的女人进行一次很棒的谈话，然后我的妻子像往常一样拍了拍我的肩膀，说她累了，想回家睡觉。”</p><p>John点了点头。他听过这对夫妇为彼此之间的协议而激烈争吵。他是一位成功的商人，而她是一位几乎放弃自己的诊所而留在家里照顾孩子的治疗师，
他们的斗争总是围绕着时间、金钱，最终是谁有权力做决定。John请他们进一步解释在派对上发生了什么导致他们决定结束治疗。</p><p>“嗯，”那个男人说，“她累了，想要离开，所以在回家的车上，我告诉她我觉得派对上的那个女人很有魅力，我很享受与她的谈话。”
当那个男人回忆起他告诉妻子他们再也没有像那样交谈过，他被派对上的女人勾引得很开心，而他的妻子很久没有对他调情了。</p><p>“那你对此有什么想法？”John问女人。</p><p>“我生气地告诉他要长大，不要再和其他女人调情。”</p><p>“那你当时在想什么？”</p><p>The woman paused for a moment and then said, “I was thinking that I wished I was with a more mature man,
and that I could do better.”</p><p>It was at that moment that John understood why his therapy hadn’t worked, and why the couple had gone through
five other therapists before coming to him. “You can go now,” he told the couple. “I know why therapy isn’t working.
Thank you.”</p><p>The couple was stunned and just sat there.
They asked John to tell them what he had learned from their argument that made things so clear to him.</p><p>“Well,” began John, “you guys were in love so you got engaged and had a wedding.
You bought a house together and you had two children together. But there’s no commitment in your relationship.
You’re always thinking maybe you can do better.
You meet a woman at a party and while you’re having a good time talking and flirting,
you’re comparing her to your wife and thinking you can do better. And when he complains to you,
you also think you could do better with a more mature man. You’re not really committed.”</p><p>The husband began to protest, “Everything I do is for my family. I sacrifice every day.
What do you mean I’m not committed?” The wife also voiced her protest about her own commitment being lacking.
“I take care of everything at home, and I also have a stressful job.”</p><p>那位女士停顿了一会，然后说道：“我当时想着我希望能和一个更成熟的男人在一起，我可以找到更好的。”</p><p>就在那一刻，John明白了为什么他的治疗没有奏效，以及为什么这对夫妇在找到他之前咨询过其他五位治疗师。“你们可以走了，”他告诉这对夫妇。
“我知道为什么治疗没有奏效了，谢谢你们。”</p><p>夫妇俩惊讶地坐在那里。他们要求John告诉他们他从他们的争吵中学到了什么，以致让他如此清楚。</p><p>“好吧，”John开始说，“你们曾经相爱，所以订婚并举行了婚礼。你们一起买了房子，一起生了两个孩子。但是你们的关系中没有承诺。
你们总是想着也许你们可以找到更好的。你在派对上遇到一个女人，当你在愉快地交谈和调情时，你在将她与你的妻子相比较，认为你可以找到更好的。
当你抱怨时，她也认为自己可以找到一个更成熟的男人。你们并没有真正承诺。”</p><p>丈夫开始抗议：“我所做的一切都是为了我的家庭。我每天都在牺牲。你怎么能说我不承诺？”妻子也对自己的承诺不足表示抗议。
“我照顾家里的一切，我还有一份压力很大的工作。”</p><p>“Let me tell you the story of Alice in Wonderland,” said John. “Alice sees this very unusual rabbit go down a hole,
and she jumps in with two feet. She has no idea what this journey is going to be and Wonderland isn’t really all
that great a place—there’re scary things, challenging things, and things that are also interesting and fascinating.
It’s an adventure, and Alice doesn’t know what’s in store for her, but she jumps in anyway.
Alice doesn’t hesitate or think maybe a better rabbit will come along tomorrow.
She feels in her heart that she’s embarking on a profound journey and that, despite the difficulties,
it’s still magical and amazing. Alice doesn’t look back and doesn’t question the adventure she’s chosen.
That’s commitment. You two never did that. You have the trappings of commitment and loyalty,
but you go to a party and think someone else can meet your needs better.
You don’t like each other’s behavior and think that means they’re not the one for you.
When you negotiate with each other, it’s always from a point of self-interest, not mutual benefit.
You haven’t built trust, or commitment,
or a foundation of loyalty to each other because you’re not really in this relationship.
That’s why no therapist can help you. You’re both still looking over your shoulder thinking the grass would be
greener if you had followed some other rabbit down some other rabbit hole, into some different wonderland.”</p><p>“让我给你们讲个爱丽丝梦游仙境的故事，”John说道。“爱丽丝看到一只非常不寻常的兔子跳进一个洞里，她毫不犹豫地跟着双脚一起跳了进去。
她不知道这个旅程会是什么样子，而仙境并不是一个那么美好的地方——那里有可怕的事情，有挑战性的事情，也有有趣和迷人的事情。
这是一次冒险，爱丽丝不知道等待着她的是什么，但她还是毫不犹豫地感到自己正在踏上一次深刻的旅程，并且尽管困难重重，仍然是魔幻而令人惊叹的。
爱丽丝不回头，也不质疑她选择的冒险。那就是承诺。而你们两个从来没有这样做过。
你们拥有承诺和忠诚的外在形式，但是当你们去参加派对时，你们认为别人可以更好地满足你们的需求。你们不喜欢对方的行为，认为这意味着他们不是适合你们的人。
当你们相互协商时，总是出于自身利益而不是互利。你们没有建立起信任、承诺和彼此忠诚的基础，因为你们并没有真正投入这段关系。
这就是为什么没有治疗师能帮助你们。你们两个仍然回头看，想着如果你们跟随其他兔子进入其他洞穴，进入另一个不同的仙境，草坪就会更绿。”</p><p>The couple left somewhat stunned, and a few months later John called to check on them.
They said that after leaving John’s office they had spent many nights talking about commitment and
loyalty and what those words really meant to each of them.
They had moved to another state and were seeing a new therapist who was helping them discover
why they had never formed a really secure attachment to each other, or ever really talked about what
their values and expectations were surrounding trust, loyalty, and commitment.
They sounded engaged and thoughtful, and John knew they now had a fighting chance.</p><p>这对夫妇有些震惊地离开了，几个月后，John打电话询问他们的近况。
他们说，在离开John的办公室后，他们花了很多晚上谈论承诺和忠诚，以及这些词对他们每个人来说实际意味着什么。
他们搬到了另一个州，并在找到一位新的治疗师，帮助他们发现为什么他们从未真正建立起彼此之间的安全依恋，也从未真正谈论过他们对信任、
忠诚和承诺的价值观和期望。他们听起来很投入、很深思熟虑，John知道他们现在有了一线希望。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discovering-your-own-wonderland">DISCOVERING YOUR OWN WONDERLAND<a class="hash-link" href="#discovering-your-own-wonderland" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>There is going to come a point in your relationship when things get difficult—when the other person annoys you,
or hurts your feelings, or lets you down. And in that dark moment when you’re angry, sad, or disappointed,
you may just wonder if you’ve chosen the right rabbit to follow down the right rabbit hole.
You may even have a moment when you wonder or even believe that you could “do better” than the person who
is in front of you at this moment annoying you, or hurting you, or letting you down.
The fact is, couples that are truly committed to each other don’t have one foot out the door.
They have invested everything in this one relationship. All their eggs are in one basket. T
hey don’t threaten to leave when times get tough.
And they don’t spend time thinking that their ideal partner is still out there somewhere,
and that that fantasy person will be easier to live with or more adept at meeting their needs than the very real,
very human, very flawed person they chose to love, honor, and cherish.
And it is worth stating again: If things aren’t going well in their relationship,
they voice their concerns to their partner instead of complaining about their partner to someone else.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="发现你自己的仙境">发现你自己的仙境<a class="hash-link" href="#发现你自己的仙境" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>在你的关系中，会有一个时刻，事情变得困难——当对方让你烦恼、伤害你或让你失望时。在那个黑暗的时刻，当你感到愤怒、悲伤或失望时，

伤害你或让你失望的人“更好”。事实上，真正致力于彼此的伴侣不会有离开的打算。他们把一切都投入到这段关系中。他们的鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里。
当时机变得艰难时，他们不会威胁要离开。他们也不会花时间去想他们理想中的伴侣是否还在别的地方，并且那个幻想中的人会比他们选择去爱、

Will he love me and care for me if I get sick? Will he leave me?</p><p>承诺一段关系需要一种特定层次的脆弱性，这可能比爱丽丝在仙境中遇到的任何事情都更可怕。她会满足我的需求吗？他真的会在我身边吗？
她会爱我真实的样子，还是试图改变我？她会对别人批评我吗？她会背叛我吗？如果我生病了，他会爱我和照顾我吗？他会离开我吗？</p><p>These are all very real fears we may have when we decide to commit to one person for a lifetime.
When we fall in love we are often on our very best behavior.
We lead with the healthiest side of ourselves. But as relationships progress, each person gets more real,
more transparent, and therefore more vulnerable. None of us has it all together,
and none of us is without our idiosyncrasies or insecurities no matter how together we may appear.
And here’s where the real magic comes in—the more honest we are,
the more we can discover that our partner really loves us for who we are,
and not the idealized version of us that shows up when we first begin to date. Vulnerability creates trust,
and trust is the oxygen your relationship needs to breathe. Trust is also built over time,
and over lots of conversations—like the ones Ben and Leah had, and the ones you’ll have in this book.
Trust is the backdrop to any relationship. It’s an action word—both a verb and a noun.
Trust happens in the little moments when we show our partner we are there for them and they do the same for us.
Trust is built in small moments of attuning to our partner, and listening like a friend and ally when our partner is
experiencing a negative emotion—sadness, anger, disgust, or fear, even if those emotions are about us.
In all of our decisions we’re thinking of maximizing our partner’s benefits as well as our own.
Mutual trust rests in the belief that both of us are thinking for two.
We aren’t negotiating for the best deal for just ourselves.
We’re always considering the cost of any choice for our partner, too.</p><p>当我们决定一辈子承诺一个人时，这些都是非常真实的恐惧。当我们坠入爱河时，我们通常会表现出最好的一面。我们展示最健康的自己。
但是随着关系的发展，每个人都变得更真实、更透明，因此也更加脆弱。我们没有一个人能完全拥有一切，也没有一个人没有自己的怪癖或不安全感，
无论我们看起来多么完美。而真正的魔力就在于，我们越诚实，就越能发现我们的伴侣真正爱我们的本来面目，而不是我们初次约会时出现的理想化版本。
脆弱性创造了信任，而信任是你们的关系所需要的氧气。信任也是随着时间的推移建立起来的，通过许多次交谈——就像本和莉娅所进行的那些交谈，
以及你在本书中将会进行的交谈。信任是任何关系的背景。它是一个行动词，既是动词又是名词。信任发生在我们向伴侣展示我们会在他们身边的那些微小时刻，
而他们也对我们做同样的事情。信任是在我们配合伴侣的小时刻中建立起来的，当我们的伴侣经历负面情绪——悲伤、愤怒、厌恶或恐惧时，
我们像朋友和盟友一样倾听。即使这些情绪是关于我们自己的。在我们所有的决策中，我们考虑的是最大化伴侣的利益和我们自己的利益。
相互的信任建立在这样一种信念上，即我们两个都在为双方考虑。我们不仅仅是为了自己争取最好的条件。我们总是考虑到任何选择对我们伴侣的代价。</p><p>There are many ways people break trust in a relationship, but here are ten of the most common:</p><p>Not showing up on time</p><p>Not making their partner a priority</p><p>Not being there when their partner is hurting or sick</p><p>Not contributing to the well-being of the family (me rather than we)</p><p>Not keeping promises</p><p>Keeping secrets</p><p>Lying</p><p>Humiliating or putting down partner in public or private</p><p>Commiting an act of emotional or physical infidelity</p><p>Being physically violent</p><p>在一段关系中，人们破坏信任的方式有很多，以下是其中十种最常见的方式：</p><p>不准时出现</p><p>不把伴侣放在优先位置</p><p>当伴侣受伤或生病时不在身边</p><p>不为家庭的福祉做出贡献（我而非我们）</p><p>不遵守承诺</p><p>保守秘密</p><p>撒谎</p><p>在公共或私人场合羞辱或贬低伴侣</p><p>进行情感或身体上的不忠行为</p><p>使用身体暴力</p><p>Each and every day we’re married or in a relationship, in every interaction, within every argument,
lie these important questions:</p><p>Do you cherish me?</p><p>How important am I to you?</p><p>Do I come first in your life?</p><p>Will you take me for granted?</p><p>Are you always looking around for someone better than me?</p><p>Will you care when I’m upset with you, and listen to my concerns?</p><p>We demonstrate the answers to these questions in ways both big and small,
and this builds our emotional investment and commitment and trust day in and day out.
We show our partner every day that we cherish his or her positive qualities and minimize
the importance of the negative qualities.
If you discuss your values around trust and make a commitment together to respect those values with your actions,
your relationship will flourish.</p><p>每一天，无论我们是结婚还是处于一段关系中，在每一次互动中，在每一次争吵中，都隐藏着这些重要的问题：</p><p>你珍视我吗？</p><p>我对你来说有多重要？</p><p>我在你的生活中排第一吗？</p><p>你会把我当作理所当然吗？</p><p>你总是四处寻找比我更好的人吗？</p><p>当我对你不满时，你会在乎并倾听我的关切吗？</p><p>我们以大小不同的方式展示这些问题的答案，这样每天积累起我们的情感投入、承诺和信任。我们每天都向伴侣展示我们珍视他们的积极品质，
并将消极品质的重要性降至最低。如果你们讨论关于信任的价值观，并共同承诺以行动尊重这些价值观，你们的关系将会蓬勃发展。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-trust-has-been-broken">WHEN TRUST HAS BEEN BROKEN<a class="hash-link" href="#when-trust-has-been-broken" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>If you break any of your agreements about trust, there are steps to fix what’s been broken.
These steps hold true for minor or major breaks, but you can’t skip any of these steps.</p><p>1  Set a specific time and place to talk.</p><p>2  Each partner names the feelings he or she experienced during the incident or breach in trust,
without blame or criticism.</p><p>3  The receiving partner listens without feedback or judgment.</p><p>4  Each person describes his or her point of view about what happened during the incident without blaming or
criticizing their partner, while their partner only listens and tries to empathize.
The listener shouldn’t bring up their own point of view until it’s their turn to speak.</p><p>5  Explain and examine any feelings that were triggered by the incident but that were originally felt long
before this relationship. For example, one of you is a no-show for a dinner date,
and that triggers a feeling of abandonment the other had from childhood or the rejection or infidelity
in a past relationship</p><p>6  Each partner assesses how they contributed to the incident and holds himself or herself accountable.</p><p>7  Each apologizes and accepts the other’s apology.</p><p>8  You make a plan together to prevent this from happening again.
Each of the eight dates are experiments in vulnerability,
and we hopethat on this first date your conversation about what trust means to each of you will
bring you not only closer together, but also closer to creating the relationship you both want for a lifetime.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="当信任被破坏时">当信任被破坏时<a class="hash-link" href="#当信任被破坏时" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>如果你违背了关于信任的任何协议，有一些步骤可以修复被破坏的部分。这些步骤适用于轻微或重大的破裂，但你不能跳过其中任何一步。</p><p>设定一个具体的时间和地点进行谈话。</p><p>每个伴侣在没有责备或批评的情况下，表达他或她在事情发生或信任被破裂时所经历的感受。</p><p>接收方伴侣聆听，不提供反馈或评判。</p><p>每个人在对方只是聆听并试图理解的情况下，描述他或她在事情发生期间的观点，不指责或批评自己的伴侣。听者在发表自己的观点之前不应提出自己的观点。</p><p>解释并检查任何在这次关系之前就已经存在的与事件触发的感受有关的感受。例如，其中一方没有按时赴约，

我们建立了承诺。我们自己心里想着没有人能与我们的伴侣相媲美，在我们的心中，我们放大伴侣的积极品质，减少负面品质。
我们思考并传达出这样的观念：无论是真实的还是想象的，没有人可以与我们的伴侣相比。</p><p>另一方面，背叛是通过向伴侣传达出他或她缺少我们无法忍受的某些品质，从而可被轻易替代的观念来培养的。

Now imagine covering the portrait with sticky notes that tell the story of all you’ve accomplished and enjoyed together.
It can be all the fun times, the comforts, the small silly things, the dreams, the frustrations that you’ve conquered.
Just consider your whole story and what living this life together so far has given you.</p><p>Now read the prompts below. Each one is a reason to communicate that you cherish your partner.
They are simple yes-or-no answers and there are so many of them for a reason.
Thinking about ways to cherish your partner will give power to your connection.
Also, we listed so many because it’s not likely that each and every one will resonate for you—but
for the ones that doresonate (hopefully a lot of them!), make a commitment to tell your partner that you cherish
this quality in them. Don’t be like the Swedish farmer who loved his wife so much that one day he almost told her.
Create a ritual time—maybe once a week—for cherishing your partner out loud.

How can we make each other feel safe?
What are our agreements about trust and commitment?</p><p>PREPARATION</p><p>Read this chapter and note any parts that particularly resonate for you. Define what trust and commitment mean to you.
Think about what trust and commitment looked like in your family of origin.
Name the little ways you and your partner show commitment to each other.</p><p>SUGGESTIONS</p><p>One partner can coordinate this date. You can decide who will be trusted to make the arrangements for
this particular date or you can flip a coin.
You can choose to surprise your partner with the location of this date, asking them to “trust you.”
If you really want to take it to the next level you can blindfold your partner on the walk or car ride
to your chosen location.</p><p>LOCATION</p><p>Find an elevated location with a great view. This could be a tall building, a bridge, a hill, etc.
Ideally there will be a bench or other comfortable spot where you and your partner can sit
while talking through the open-ended questions. If possible, make this first date location somewhere that
is meaningful to your love story. If it were Ben and Leah, they might have a date at the top of the steps where they met.
Make it a beautiful or peaceful place. Wherever you decide to have this first date,
make sure that whoever is making the plans picks a place that is private and quiet enough for you to
have an honest conversation. This is a vulnerable topic and you want to feel safe enough to share openly.</p><p>速配：信任与承诺</p><p>对话话题：</p><p>我们的关系中信任和承诺是什么样的？我们如何让彼此感到安全？关于信任和承诺，我们有哪些共识？</p><p>准备：</p><p>阅读本章，并记录下特别引人共鸣的部分。定义信任和承诺对你来说意味着什么。思考一下在你成长的家庭中信任和承诺是什么样子。
列举一下你和伴侣彼此展现承诺的细微之处。</p><p>建议：</p><p>其中一位伴侣可以协调这次约会。你们可以决定谁将负责安排这次约会，或者可以抛硬币来决定。你可以选择用约会地点给伴侣一个惊喜，要求他们“相信你”。
如果你真的想将其提升到另一个层次，你可以在去目的地的步行或车程中给伴侣蒙上眼睛。</p><p>地点：</p><p>寻找一个可以俯瞰的地方，拥有美景。这可以是一个高楼、桥梁、山丘等。理想情况下，会有一张长凳或其他舒适的地方，你和伴侣可以坐下来，
一边交谈一边回答开放性问题。如果可能，让这个第一次约会的地点与你们的爱情故事有特殊的意义。
比如，如果是本和莉娅的约会，他们可能会选择在他们相识的楼梯顶端约会。选择一个美丽或宁静的地方。
无论你决定在哪里进行这次第一次约会，请确保制定计划的人选择了一个足够私密和安静的地方，以便你们可以坦诚地交谈。
这是一个脆弱的话题，你希望感到足够安全，可以坦率地分享。</p><p>AT-HOME DATE:</p><p>If you’ve decided to have this date at home, here is an idea: You can take turns being blindfolded
while the other person guides you around the house.
It’s a great opportunity to practice clear communications (“you’re about to go through a doorway,”
“take a step up here”) and practicing care for the partner being guided, and trust in the partner doing the guiding</p><p>BRING</p><p>You should bring an open mind and be prepared to discuss any thoughts that came up around trust and commitment
while reading this chapter and doing the exercise.</p><p>Please also read through the troubleshooting guide below before you have this conversation.
Trust can be an especially triggering conversation, and there are some ground rules to agree on before you begin.</p><p>在家中的约会：</p><p>如果你决定在家中进行这次约会，有一个想法：你们可以轮流蒙上眼睛，让另一方引导你在房子里走动。
这是一个很好的机会来练习清晰的沟通（“你即将穿过一个门口”，“在这里上一步”），同时也锻炼被引导的伴侣的关爱和对引导者的信任。</p><p>带上：</p><p>你应该带上一颗开放的心，并准备好讨论在阅读本章和进行练习时对信任和承诺产生的任何想法。</p><p>在开始这次对话之前，请确保</p><p>也阅读下面的故障排除指南。谈论信任可能会触发某些敏感点，因此在开始之前需要达成一些共识的基本规则。</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING</p><p>Stay open-minded to your partner.</p><p>Avoid turning your conversation into blaming or making accusations about past trust breaches between you.
Don’t minimize fears.</p><p>Ask your partner questions about why their beliefs about trust and commitment are important and meaningful to them.</p><p>Be honest about your needs.</p><p>Avoid trying to force your partner to believe what you believe when it comes to trust, loyalty, and commitment.</p><p>See your differences as opportunities to learn more about each other and create a shared value system
for trust and commitment.</p><p>Avoid criticizing or judging.</p><p>故障排除：</p><p>对伴侣保持开放的心态。</p><p>避免将对话变成相互指责或指控对方违反信任的过去行为。不要轻视恐惧感。</p><p>向伴侣询问他们对信任和承诺的信念为什么对他们重要和有意义。</p><p>对自己的需求保持诚实。</p><p>在谈论信任、忠诚和承诺时，避免试图强迫伴侣接受自己的信念。</p><p>将你们的差异视为更好地了解彼此并创建共同的信任和承诺价值体系的机会。</p><p>避免批评或评判对方。</p><p>OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DATE CONVERSATION</p><p>Ask each other the following questions. (We’ve suggested language for these questions,
but please feel free to ask the questions in a way that is natural and best for you and your relationship.)
For the research couples who went on these dates, all chose to use these questions as written here,
but feel free to add your own:</p><p>How did your parents show their commitment to each other? How did they show a lack of commitment to each other?
In your mind, what do these things in your family history mean for the two of us?</p><p>What does trust mean to you?</p><p>Can you describe a time where you didn’t feel you trusted me, and what I could have done to fix the situation?</p><p>What do you need from me in order for you to trust me even more?</p><p>What do you need from me to show that I am committed to this relationship?</p><p>What areas do you think we need to work on to build trust between us?</p><p>How are we similar and how are we different when it comes to trust and commitment? How can we accept these differences?</p><p>以下是你们约会对话中的开放性问题。</p><p>（我们为这些问题提供了建议的语言，但请随意以最自然和适合你们关系的方式提问。）对于那些进行这些约会的研究对象，他们选择按照这里写的问题进行，
但你可以随意添加自己的问题：</p><p>你的父母是如何展示彼此的承诺的？他们又是如何展示对彼此缺乏承诺的？在你看来，你们家族历史中的这些事情对我们俩意味着什么？</p><p>对你来说，信任意味着什么？</p><p>你能描述一次你觉得你没有信任我，并且我可以做些什么来解决这种情况的时刻吗？</p><p>为了让你对我更加信任，你需要我做什么？</p><p>为了显示我对这段关系的承诺，你需要我做什么？</p><p>在建立我们之间的信任方面，你认为我们需要改进的地方有哪些？</p><p>在信任和承诺方面，我们在哪些方面相似，又在哪些方面不同？我们如何接受这些差异？</p><p>AFFIRMING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER</p><p>Take turns reading this affirmation out loud to each other. Maintain eye contact while reciting.</p><p>I commit to choosing you each and every day and to showing you that our relationship is a priority.
I also commit to having seven more dates and conversations.</p><p>肯定我们的未来</p><p>轮流向彼此大声朗读下面的肯定句。在朗读时保持眼神交流。</p><p>我承诺每一天都选择你，并向你展示我们的关系是我优先考虑的。我还承诺再进行七次约会和对话。</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="date-2">DATE 2<a class="hash-link" href="#date-2" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Agree to Disagree</p><p>ADDRESSING CONFLICT</p><p>Wesley and Marie had lived together for two years before deciding to get married.
When they decided to discuss conflict, they were just beginning their second year of marriage and liked to say they
were still in their honeymoon phase. “We never argue. We never fight. We’re each other’s best friend,
and I can’t think of a single thing we’ve ever fought over,” said Marie. They gained insight into conflict on this date.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="第二次约会">第二次约会<a class="hash-link" href="#第二次约会" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>不同意也可以</p><p>解决冲突</p><p>韦斯利和玛丽在决定结婚前已经同居了两年。当他们决定讨论冲突时，他们正处于婚姻的第二年，喜欢说他们仍然处在蜜月期。玛丽说：“我们从来不争吵。
我们从来不打架。我们是彼此最好的朋友，我想不出我们曾经为什么事情争吵过。”他们通过这次约会对冲突有了一些见解。</p><p>This state of marital peacefulness that passes for “bliss” that Marie describes is actually just the quietness that
results from avoiding conflict. Conflict happens.
And one of the great marriage myths is that if you never fight or discuss difficult and uncomfortable issues,
then that means you have a “good” relationship. When you get married it’s not just two people who are joining together,
it’s also your different habits, personalities, belief systems, and quirks joining together.
All of these things can make for quite a wild party, and if you enter into any long-term relationship thinking
that the hallmark of its success is a lack of conflict, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment and failure.</p><p>The couple did have one conflict they seemed to struggle over.
Wesley liked to have the television on while he fell asleep. Marie didn’t.
She preferred silence and could go to sleep quickly if the television was off,
but found herself night after night staying awake until Wesley fell asleep, then turning off the TV so she could sleep.
Marie had brought it up on occasion, but never really shared exactly how much it really bothered her.
But when her job changed and she had to get up earlier, she found herself more and more annoyed with what she began to
see as Wesley’s selfish ways. She would lie awake at night thinking about how she paid half the mortgage,
and she had bought their new bed with him, and how she felt like a visitor in his world.
Her anger grew and her resentment built, and still she said nothing. Eventually,
Marie started wondering if she had made the right decision in marrying Wesley.
Was she just going to have to be the one who sacrificed and compromised,
while he got his way every time? Was this how the next 60 years of her life were going to be?</p><p>Wesley started thinking that Marie was getting more and more snappy and impatient.
One of the reasons he had married her was because she was the kindest person he had ever met,
and always greeted him with a smile. He loved making her laugh,
but more and more his banter and humor were met with silence. He had no idea what was bothering her,
and when he asked her if anything was wrong she would tell him everything was fine.
Wesley wondered if he had made a mistake. He wondered who this stone-faced woman was in front of him,
and where the happy, beautiful woman he had married had gone.</p><p>Eventually Wesley confronted Marie, demanding to know what was wrong and why she was treating him so badly.
Marie was shocked. In her mind, he was the one treating her badly. He was the selfish one.
Marie finally told him what had been bothering her for so long, and then she burst into tears,
saying, “I guess it’s over for us.”</p><p>这种玛丽所描述的婚姻平静的状态，实际上只是通过避免冲突而带来的宁静。冲突是不可避免的。
一个伟大的婚姻谬论之一是认为如果你从不争吵或讨论困难和不舒服的问题，那就意味着你有一段“好”的关系。当你结婚时，加入的不仅仅是两个人，
还有你们不同的习惯、个性、信仰系统和怪癖。所有这些因素可能会导致一场相当混乱的派对，如果你进入任何长期关系，并认为其成功的标志是没有冲突，
那么你将让自己失望并失败。</p><p>这对夫妇确实有一个冲突，他们似乎为此而苦恼。韦斯利喜欢在入睡时开着电视。而玛丽不喜欢。她喜欢安静，如果电视关掉，她可以很快入睡，
但她发现自己晚上一夜又一夜地等到韦斯利入睡后才关掉电视，这样她才能入睡。玛丽偶尔提到过这个问题，但从未真正分享过这个问题对她的真正困扰有多大。
但当她的工作变化，她不得不更早起床时，她发现自己越来越烦恼，开始认为韦斯利是自私的。她晚上躺在床上想着她支付了一半的抵押贷款，
她和他一起买了新床，她觉得自己像是他世界里的一个访客。她的愤怒增长，她的怨恨积累，但她仍然保持沉默。最终，玛丽开始怀疑自己是否做了正确的决定，
嫁给了韦斯利。她是否只能是那个牺牲和妥协的人，而他每次都能如愿以偿？她的未来60年会是这样吗？</p><p>韦斯利开始觉得玛丽变得越来越暴躁和不耐烦。他娶她的原因之一就是因为她是他曾经遇到的最善良的人，总是带着微笑迎接他。他喜欢逗她笑，
但越来越多的时候，他的玩笑和幽默只能得到沉默作为回应。他不知道她到底在烦什么，当他问她是否有什么问题时，她总是说一切都好。
韦斯利开始怀疑自己是否犯了个错误。他想知道眼前这个一脸冷漠的女人是谁，他娶的那个开朗、美丽的女人到哪里去了。</p><p>最终，韦斯利质问玛丽，要求知道到底出了什么问题，为什么她对他如此恶劣。玛丽感到震惊。在她心中，他才是对她不好的人。
玛丽终于告诉了他那么长时间以来一直困扰着她的问题，然后她哭了起来，说：“我想我们的关系结束了。”</p><p>Wesley was dumbfounded. He told her that growing up with a single mom who worked two jobs,
he was alone most of the time and the television was all he had. “One time,
our house was broken into and the television was stolen. I was devastated.
It was my only comfort at night and with the TV gone, I had nothing. It was horrible. Lonely and horrible.”</p><p>Marie had never heard this story, and her heart cracked open for the little boy her husband had once been.</p><p>“But why would you think it’s over between us?” Wesley asked. “It’s just a television, we can figure something out.”</p><p>As it turned out, Marie never fought with Wesley because she was afraid of all conflict. Growing up,
she never heard her parents fight but whenever things got difficult, her mom would gather up Marie
and her brother and sister and leave the house to check into a hotel.
It didn’t matter if it was the middle of the night, or they had school the next day,
her mom would hurry them all into the car and drive away to the nearest hotel where she would act
like they were on vacation. They swam in the pool, ordered room service,
and then returned home after a few days where no one spoke about why they had left or why they had returned.
The only time Marie ever heard her parents yelling was right before they told her they were getting divorced.
Later on, when Marie was in high school, and her mother was single and dating,
her mom would break up with a boyfriend by changing their home phone number. Marie hadn’t realized it,
but she had internalized the idea that all conflict was to be avoided and if there ever was a fight,
it meant the relationship was over.</p><p>Sharing these stories was a relationship game changer for Wesley and Marie. For Marie,
having a disagreement and being able to talk about it was nothing short of miraculous.
Not only did it not end their relationship, she felt closer to him than ever because they
had both shared these childhood stories. “Our relationship has gone to the next level.
It feels more real,” says Marie. “I almost look forward to our conflicts now,
because we always seem to come out of them understanding something new about each other and it brings us closer and closer.
I don’t go looking for fights, but I don’t run away from them anymore either.
I love that feeling when we get through a hard time together. That’s what a relationship is all about.
Even when we disagree, we’re still on the same team, trying to find a way to understand each other and work it out.”
As for the television issue—they have a remote now with a timer that will turn the television off after 20 minutes.</p><p>Wesley感到目瞪口呆。他告诉玛丽，他在单亲妈妈两份工作的环境下长大，大部分时间都是一个人，电视是他唯一的伴侣。
“有一次，我们家被人闯入，电视被偷走了。我心碎了。它是我晚上唯一的安慰，而现在没有了电视，我什么都没有了。那感觉太可怕了。孤独而可怕。”</p><p>玛丽从未听过这个故事，她的心为她的丈夫曾经是一个小男孩而破碎开来。</p><p>“但你为什么认为我们之间结束了？”韦斯利问道。“这只是一个电视，我们可以想办法解决。”</p><p>事实证明，玛丽从未与韦斯利争吵，因为她害怕任何冲突。在她成长的过程中，她从未听到父母争吵过，但每当事情变得困难时，
她的妈妈会带着玛丽和她的兄弟姐妹离开家去住进旅馆。无论是半夜还是第二天要上学，她的妈妈都会匆忙把他们都塞进车里，开车去最近的旅馆，
就像他们在度假一样。他们在游泳池里游泳，点餐送餐，然后几天后回家，没有人谈论为什么他们离开了或为什么他们回来了。
玛丽唯一听到父母大声争吵的时候是在他们告诉她他们要离婚之前。后来，当玛丽上高中时，她的母亲单身并且有约会对象，
她的母亲会通过更换家庭电话号码来结束和男朋友的关系。玛丽没有意识到，但她已经内化了一个观念，即所有的冲突都应该避免，
如果有争吵，就意味着关系已经结束了。</p><p>分享这些故事对于韦斯利和玛丽的关系来说是一个重要的转折点。对玛丽来说，发生争议并且能够谈论它简直是奇迹。这不仅没有结束他们的关系，
而且她感觉比以往更亲近，因为他们都分享了这些童年的故事。“我们的关系进入了新的阶段。它感觉更真实，”玛丽说。“我几乎期待我们的争议，
因为我们似乎总是从中了解到彼此新的东西，并且变得越来越亲近。我不是在寻找争吵，但我也不再逃避它们。我喜欢我们一起度过困难时刻的感觉。
这就是一段关系的真谛。即使我们意见不合，我们仍然是同一支队伍，努力寻找理解彼此和解决问题的方法。”至于电视的问题，
他们现在有了一个带有定时器的遥控器，可以在20分钟后关闭电视。</p><p>For most of the couples that went on this date, like Wesley and Marie, they used it as a way to
examine their differences and work toward understanding and acceptance of these differences.
Listening to each other’s stories is a powerful way to navigate disagreements.</p><p>对于大多数参加这次约会的夫妇来说，就像Wesley和Marie一样，他们将其视为一种审视彼此差异并努力理解和接受这些差异的方式。
倾听彼此的故事是在处理分歧时的一种有力方法。</p><p>MANAGING CONFLICT</p><p>It may seem odd to have a conversation about conflict, but the best time to discuss how you’re going to
manage conflict is not while you are in the middle of a heated argument.
The important thing to know is that relationship conflict is natural, and it serves a purpose.
What is the purpose of conflict? Does conflict even have a goal?
Many people think that conflict is pointless and harmful. Not true.
Conflict is necessary because we inevitably run into speed bumps in our ability to love one another,
and when we hit one of these speed bumps we need to slow down and proceed with care.</p><p>Mutual understanding: This is the healthiest and most productive goal of all conflict.</p><p>That may surprise you. The goal of conflict is not to win or to convince the other person that you’re right or
even to be the same. In creating compromise we have to understand each other’s core needs on the issue we’re discussing,
as well as each other’s areas of flexibility. However, the goal is not to become identical,
it’s to understand each other.</p><p>As Marie and Wesley found out, managing conflict helps us love each other better over time,
understand each other at a deeper level, and renew our commitment to the relationship.
None of us are perfect communicators, not even those of us who are marriage therapists or have been married for decades.</p><p>Here’s another headline: Our research has shown that most relational conflict is not resolvable.
Each relationship comes with a set of problems because each person is unique and different from others,
and some set of problems is going to be there no matter who the other partner might be.
Time and time again we hear of couples divorcing because of their problems,
and then remarrying only to find they have similar or new problems in the new relationship.</p><p>Many of our problems travel with us, reincarnating in each relationship,
until eventually we learn to recognize them for what they are and manage them appropriately.
A big source of trouble is the misconception that our problems are all solvable.
Our research has shown that 69 percent of the time, when couples talk about that one thing that they always argue about,
it’s what we call a perpetual problem. It’s not going to be resolved.
Relationships work to the extent that you have a set of perpetual problems that you can learn to live with.
And the great gift is that within these conflicts, within these perpetual problems that you can’t ever seem to resolve,
lie the greatest opportunities for growth and intimacy. When you discover what lies beneath those problems,
you uncover something that is at the core of your partner’s belief system or personality.
Obviously there are conflicts that can be deal breakers as we mentioned in the introduction—one of you wants children
and the other doesn’t, one refuses treatment for a substance abuse problem or addiction,
domestic violence—but for the most part, problems are either perpetual problems
(they can’t be solved and will never be solved) or they’re solvable problems.</p><p>谈论冲突可能看起来有些奇怪，但最好的时间来讨论如何处理冲突并不是在你们正处于激烈争论的时候。重要的是要知道，情侣之间的冲突是自然而然的，
而且它有其目的。冲突的目的是什么？冲突是否有一个目标？许多人认为冲突是毫无意义且有害的。事实并非如此。
冲突是必要的，因为我们在彼此的爱中不可避免地会遇到阻碍，当我们遇到这些阻碍时，我们需要减速并小心前行。</p><p>相互理解：这是所有冲突中最健康和最有成效的目标。</p><p>这可能会让你感到意外。冲突的目标不是赢得胜利，也不是说服对方你是对的，甚至不是变得相同。在达成妥协时，我们必须理解彼此在我们讨论的问题上的核心需求，
以及彼此的灵活性范围。然而，目标不是变得相同，而是相互理解。</p><p>正如Marie和Wesley所发现的，有效管理冲突有助于我们随着时间更好地互相爱护，更深入地理解彼此，并更新我们对关系的承诺。我们没有人是完美的沟通者，
即使是那些婚姻治疗师或已婚数十年的人也是如此。</p><p>另一个重点是：我们的研究表明，大多数关系冲突是无法解决的。每段关系都伴随着一系列问题，因为每个人都是独特且不同于他人的，而且不管是与哪个伴侣在一起，
一些问题总会存在。我们一次又一次听到夫妻因为他们的问题而离婚，然后再婚，只发现在新的关系中他们有着类似或新的问题。</p><p>许多问题会伴随我们一生，不断在每段关系中重现，直到我们最终学会将它们识别为它们真正的本质并适当地处理它们。
一个大问题的源头是对我们的问题都是可以解决的这个误解。我们的研究表明，在夫妻谈论他们总是争论的那个问题时，有69%的时间属于我们所说的永恒问题。
它无法解决。关系的工作在于你拥有一系列无法解决的永恒问题，你可以学会与之共处。最伟大的礼物在于，在这些冲突中，在这些你似乎永远无法解决的永恒问题中，
蕴藏着最大的成长和亲密机会。当你发现问题背后的真相时，你揭示了伴侣信念系统或个性的核心。当然，正如我们在介绍中提到的，有些冲突可能是不能容忍的，
比如一个人想要孩子，而另一个人不想要；一个人拒绝接受药物治疗或戒毒，家庭暴力等。但大部分问题要么是永恒问题（无法解决且永远无法解决），
要么是可解决问题。</p><p>SOLVABLE PROBLEMS:These are situational problems. You argue about housework, who picks up the kids on Fridays,
or where to go on vacation. The conflict is about the topic, and there is no deeper meaning behind the position.
He leaves the toilet seat up, she hates sitting down on the cold rim because it’s been left up.
It’s an annoyance, but there’s no deeper meaning to why he leaves it up and she wants it down.
With solvable problems, there is a solution and this solution can be sustained.
You share the housework, split time picking up kids, each choose a vacation spot, etc.
Solvable doesn’t mean without work.
It takes effort and action to keep the agreements you make with each other for the solvable problems</p><p>PERPETUAL PROBLEMS:These are problems that center on fundamental differences you have in your personalities or
lifestyle preferences. These are the problems that you return to over and over again.
These could be differences in basic needs, punctuality, organization, amount of time spent alone or together,
differences in how to celebrate Christmas, or how to relate to in-laws.
Even how you choose to exercise can be a fundamental difference if he likes to take a leisurely stroll around
the neighborhood, and she believes a gym membership is a must in order to be healthy.
You can’t “solve” your personality or preferred lifestyle differences, nor should you try.
Recognizing a perpetual problem for what it is leads to accepting and valuing how each of you is different.
At the core of managing conflict, especially when it comes to a perpetual problem,
is accepting your partner for who they are. When you accept what you can’t change, you accept each other.
Accept your partner for who they are, and they’ll do the same. Celebrate and learn from your differences.</p><p>可解决的问题：这些是情境性的问题。你们可能争论家务事、谁在星期五接孩子，或者去哪里度假。冲突只是围绕着具体话题，没有更深层次的意义。
他把马桶座子放起来，她讨厌坐在冰冷的马桶圈上。这只是一种烦恼，没有更深层次的原因解释他为什么把马桶座子放起来，她为什么希望放下来。
对于可解决的问题，存在解决方案，并且这个解决方案可以持续存在。你们可以分享家务事，分担接孩子的时间，各自选择度假地点等。可解决并不意味着没有工作。
为了保持你们在可解决的问题上所达成的协议，需要努力和行动。</p><p>永恒问题：这些问题集中在你们个性或生活方式偏好的根本差异上。这些是你们一次又一次回到的问题。
这些问题可能涉及到基本需求、守时性、组织能力、独处或共处时间的不同，以及如何庆祝圣诞节或与姻亲相处的差异。
即使选择如何锻炼身体也可能成为一种基本差异，例如他喜欢在社区悠闲散步，而她认为必须拥有健身房会员资格才能保持健康。
你不能&quot;解决&quot;你们的个性或偏好生活方式的差异，也不应该试图去做。认识到永恒问题的本质是接受和珍视彼此的不同。
在处理冲突时，特别是涉及永恒问题时，接受你的伴侣是谁是核心。当你接受你无法改变的事实时，你就接受了彼此。接受你的伴侣是他们的样子，
他们也会同样地接受你。从你们的差异中庆祝并学习。</p><p>A WORD ABOUT GRIDLOCK</p><p>Nobody likes gridlock, that feeling of being stuck and going nowhere.
This can happen when you end up going round after round in conflict over a perpetual problem.
You’ll know your perpetual problem has become gridlocked when you have the same conversation and
arguments over and over again with no progress. The discussion leaves one or both of you feeling frustrated,
hurt, or rejected. You end up seeing your partner as the enemy. Marie started vilifying Wesley in her head,
and his going to sleep with the television on became a symbol of his extreme selfishness in all areas.
If you find that the two of you get more and more polarized, more extreme, and more uncompromising, you’re gridlocked.
Eventually this will lead to emotional distance between the two of you,
and this is the real relationship killer—not anger, or arguments,
or conflict in general—but the distance you let it create between you.
We’ll discuss gridlocked conflict more in our last chapter on fulfilling each other’s dreams.</p><p>Because within every gridlocked conflict, there is a longing and a dream in each person’s position about this issue,
a dream buried under the surface ready to be uncovered. Conflict can bring you closer,
if you choose to approach it as a way to know your partner more.
If you genuinely seek understanding of your partner’s position,
you can create deeper intimacy and a stronger relationship, through any disagreement.
When your partner expresses anger, instead of acting defensive and attacking back, try asking yourself,
or even asking your partner, what does he or she need, what is the unmet desire or hope that hasn’t yet been met.
Through any argument, if you can communicate that you love and accept your partner,
even if you deeply disagree with them, your relationship and marriage can not only survive but also thrive.
Couples who have been married for decades have learned to see their partner’s shortcomings, quirks,
and personality differences as more amusing than frustrating. When we truly love someone, we love all of them,
and accept them just as they are.</p><p>关于僵局的一点说明</p><p>没有人喜欢僵局，那种感觉就像是被困住无法前进。当你在永恒问题上陷入一次又一次的冲突中时，就可能会发生这种情况。
你会知道你的永恒问题已经陷入僵局，当你一遍又一遍地进行相同的对话和争论，却没有任何进展时。这种讨论会让你和/或伴侣感到沮丧、受伤或被拒绝。
你最终会把你的伴侣视为敌人。玛丽在心里开始诋毁韦斯利，他在开着电视睡觉成为他在各个方面极端自私的象征。
如果你发现你们越来越极端、越来越偏执、越来越不愿妥协，那么你们就陷入了僵局。
最终，这会导致你们之间的情感距离，而这才是真正破坏关系的因素——不是愤怒、争论或一般的冲突，而是你们允许它在你们之间制造的距离。
我们将在最后一章中更详细地讨论僵局冲突，涉及实现彼此梦想的问题。</p><p>因为在每一个僵局冲突中，每个人在这个问题上都有一种渴望和梦想，一种隐藏在表面下准备被揭示的梦想。如果你选择把冲突看作是更加了解你的伴侣的一种方式，
冲突可以让你们更亲近。如果你真诚地寻求理解伴侣的立场，你可以通过任何分歧创建更深层次的亲密和更强大的关系。
当你的伴侣表达愤怒时，不要采取防御和反击，试着问问自己，甚至问问你的伴侣，他或她需要什么，有什么未满足的愿望或希望。通过任何争论，
如果你能传达出你爱和接受你的伴侣，即使你对他们的观点深深不同，你的关系和婚姻不仅可以存活，而且可以茁壮成长。
几十年来结婚的夫妻学会了把伴侣的缺点、怪癖和个性差异看作是更有趣而不是令人沮丧的。当我们真正爱一个人时，我们爱他们的全部，并接受他们的原样。</p><p>FIGHT FAIR AND REPAIR</p><p>Out of the many couples who did the exercise that follows, went on this date, and asked each other
the open-ended questions, only one had a fight. That’s right: Discussing conflict led to conflict,
but only for one of the couples. If it happens to you on this date, or on any of the dates, it’s really okay.
Fights are going to happen in any relationship—it’s inevitable and it’s healthy—but research shows that couples
who are genuinely happy in their marriage or relationship handle their conflicts in gentle, positive ways.
They listen to their partner’s perspective, they seek to understand their partner,
and they work together to find a compromise that works for both.</p><p>战斗公平，修复关系</p><p>在进行下面的练习、约会和彼此提问的众多夫妻中，只有一对夫妻吵了架。没错：讨论冲突引发了冲突，但只有一对夫妻遇到了这种情况。
如果在这个约会或其他约会中发生了争吵，其实没关系。在任何关系中都会发生争吵——这是不可避免的，也是健康的——但研究显示，
真正幸福的夫妻或伴侣以温和、积极的方式处理冲突。他们倾听伴侣的观点，努力理解对方，并共同努力找到对双方都适用的妥协方案。</p><p>This is easy to read in a book, but sometimes we say and do things that damage our partner.
We forget about seeking understanding, and we give a 20-minute diatribe on why we’re right and they’re wrong.
We get defensive, we criticize, we show contempt, and we turn away at the very moment we should
be turning toward each other. We call these regrettable incidents—our nice term for a fight,
and “master couples” know how to minimize the damage from words said in the heat of an argument.
In John and Julie’s research they divided their couples into “masters” and “disasters.”
Master couples stayed together happily. Disaster couples split up, or stayed together unhappily.
When it came to conflict, the masters always knew how to repair the damage done during a regrettable incident.</p><p>Below is a process of repair for when regrettable incidents happen, and this should be part of your system
for managing conflict in your relationship. Processing a fight means talking about what happened during the fight,
without jumping back into the ring with your boxing gloves on. It’s the fight recap,
where you figure out how to make this particular matchup go better in the future.
The goal here is not to once again argue for your reality or prove that you’re right and they’re wrong;
it’s to understand what reality looks like to the other person.
Both of you are right in your own feelings and perceptions,
and you’re capable of looking at the situation through your partner’s eyes.</p><p>这在书中很容易阅读，但有时我们会说和做一些伤害伴侣的事情。
我们忘记寻求理解，然后对着伴侣发表长达20分钟的长篇大论，解释为什么我们是对的，他们是错的。
我们变得防御，批评，表现出轻蔑，并在我们应该互相靠近的时刻转身离去。
我们称之为“可悔事故”——对我们来说是一场争吵，而“掌控者夫妻”知道如何将在争吵过程中造成的伤害降到最低。
在约翰和朱莉的研究中，他们将夫妻分为“掌控者”和“灾难者”。
掌控者夫妻幸福地在一起。灾难者夫妻分手，或者在一起时不幸福。当涉及到冲突时，掌控者总是知道如何修复在可悔事故中造成的伤害。</p><p>以下是当发生可悔事故时的修复过程，这应该是你们处理冲突的一部分。处理一场争吵意味着谈论争吵过程中发生了什么，而不是带上拳击手套重新投入擂台。
这是争吵回顾，你要弄清楚如何让这场特定的对决在未来变得更好。这里的目标不是再次争论你的真实感受或证明你是对的，而他们是错的；
而是要理解对于另一个人来说，现实是什么样子的。在你们自己的感受和认知中，你们都是对的，而且你们有能力通过对伴侣的角度看待情况。</p><p>STEP 1:</p><p>Each person takes a turn to talk about what they were feelingduring the fight: Were you feeling sad, angry, worried,
lonely, ashamed, unappreciated, defensive, or any other emotions and feelings? Perhaps you were feeling
out of control or confused.</p><p>STEP 2:</p><p>Each person should talk about how they saw the situation and their perspective about what actually happened
in the argument. Keep in mind that you may have two very different realities of what happened, but both are right.
Avoid contesting who remembers it better. Validateeach other’s realities. Validating doesn’t mean agreeing.
It means being able to complete a sentence like, “From your point of view it makes sense to me that
you would have these feelings and needs. I get it.” If you think it would be helpful,
review the “Art of Listening” at the beginning of this book.
Communicate to your partner that you understand some of their perspective.
Only talk about the feelings and needs you had. Use “I” statements. Don’t tell your partner what they did or didn’t do.
As much as possible, avoid pointing your finger at your partner and blaming.
It’s better to say “I heard you saying  .  .  .” than to say “You said  .  .  .”
The former phrasing makes it clear that it’s your perspective, not necessarily the facts.
There’s no immaculate perception.</p><p>STEP 3:</p><p>Triggers.In some regrettable incidents (not all) there are reasons that the conflict has escalated.
We call these &quot;triggers.&quot; They are old, enduring vulnerabilitiesthat occurred before this relationship began and
have left emotional scars that can get activated. When you feel triggered,
search your memory for a point in your history or childhood when you had a similar set of feelings.
Triggers never go away, they endure.</p><p>Instructions. If you feel triggered, tell your partner the story of what happened in your past,
so your partner can understand your own particular sensitivities and why this is a trigger for you.
If you are the partner, express understanding and empathy as your partner describes the incident and the connection.
Examples of trigger emotions that may help you connect a feeling to an incident:</p><p>STEP 1:</p><p>每个人轮流谈论他们在争吵中的感受：你是感到伤心、愤怒、担心、孤独、羞愧、不被欣赏、防御还是其他情绪和感受？也许你感到失控或困惑。</p><p>STEP 2:</p><p>每个人都应该谈谈他们对情况的看法，以及他们对争论中实际发生的事情的观点。要记住，你们可能对发生的事情有两种完全不同的看法，但都是正确的。
避免争论谁更好地记得。验证对方的现实。验证并不意味着同意，而是能够说出这样的句子：“从你的角度来看，我理解你会有这些感受和需求。我明白。”
如果你认为有帮助，可以回顾本书开头的“倾听的艺术”。向伴侣传达你理解他们某些观点的意思。只谈论你自己的感受和需求。使用“我”这样的陈述。
不要告诉伴侣他们做了什么或没做什么。尽量避免指责伴侣。最好说“我听到你说过……”而不是说“你说过……”。前一种措辞明确表示这是你的观点，不一定是事实。
没有完美的观点。</p><p>STEP 3:</p><p>触发器。在一些可悔事故中（并非全部），冲突升级的原因是存在一些触发器。我们称之为“触发器”。
它们是发生在这段关系开始之前的旧的、持久的脆弱性，留下了可能被激活的情感伤痕。当你感到被触发时，回忆一下你的记忆中是否有类似的感受。
触发器永远不会消失，它们持久存在。</p><p>指导。如果你感到被触发，请告诉你的伴侣过去发生的事情，这样你的伴侣就能理解你自己特定的敏感性以及为什么这对你而言是一个触发器。
如果你是伴侣，当你的伴侣描述这件事和联系时，表达理解和同情。以下是一些触发情绪的例子，可能有助于将感受与事件联系起来：</p><p>A time when I felt judged.</p><p>A time when I felt excluded.</p><p>A time when I felt humiliated and disrespected.</p><p>A time when I felt abandoned.</p><p>A time when I felt powerless.</p><p>A time when I was bullied.</p><p>A time when I felt alone.</p><p>A time when I felt out of control.</p><p>A time when I felt belittled.</p><p>A time when I felt very unsafe.</p><p>A time when I was assaulted and attacked.</p><p>一个让我感到受到评判的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到被排斥的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到羞辱和不尊重的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到被抛弃的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到无力的时刻。</p><p>一个让我受到欺凌的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到孤独的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到失去控制的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到被贬低的时刻。</p><p>一个让我感到非常不安全的时刻。</p><p>一个让我遭受袭击和攻击的时刻。</p><p>STEP 4:Accept responsibilityand own up to your part in the fight. Perhaps you’ve been overly stressed or preoccupied,
or you haven’t made time for your partner, or you haven’t been a good listener.
What can you own up to in how you contributed to the argument? It’s important to avoid blame here.
We discovered in our research that taking responsibility—even for a small part of the problem
in communication—presents the opportunity for great repair. It’s highly effective.</p><p>STEP 5:Discuss how you both might do things differentlythe next time.
What’s one way your partner can make it better if this type of incident happens again?
What’s one way you can make it better? Create a plan together to minimize hurt feelings and avoid an incident
in the future.</p><p>STEP 4: 接受责任并承认自己在争吵中的角色。也许你一直过于紧张或心事重重，或者没有为伴侣腾出时间，或者没有做一个好的倾听者。
你在争论中如何做出贡献，你可以承认自己的责任是什么？在这里要避免责怪。我们在研究中发现，即使在沟通问题中承担小部分责任，也为修复提供了重要的机会。
这是非常有效的。</p><p>STEP 5: 讨论下一次如何做出不同的改变。如果再次发生这种情况，你的伴侣可以如何让事情变得更好？你可以如何让事情变得更好？
一起制定一个计划，以减少受伤的感觉，并避免将来发生类似的冲突。</p><p>Exercise</p><p>WE ALL HAVE ISSUES</p><p>We have created a list of 25 topics that could represent fundamental differences in your personalities
that could create conflict, or fundamental differences in your lifestyle needs that may also be a source of conflict.
Lifestyle needs are basic to your identity, and to who you are as a person.</p><p>This exercise is an opportunity to get to know each other in new ways, and to be curious about what your potential
sources of conflict might be during your relationship. Look over each item.
Pick the top three to five that jump out at you. Write down how you feel about each of the issues you selected.
Do you feel it’s a significant conflict right now? Do you think it will be a source of conflict in the future?
You’re going to discuss these on your date, so take some time to consider the topic.
Some couples chose to explore every topic and wrote down how they felt about every area.
Do what seems reasonable for you.</p><p>Remember that you’re ultimately seeking an understanding of your partner’s interior world,
and creating shared meaning together. If punctuality is important to your partner,
and you think punctual is arriving no more than an hour late,
discuss why it’s so important or not so important to each other. There’s usually a story underneath every strong emotion.
Be ready to tell each other your stories and seek the understanding that’ll help you manage your
conflicts skillfully and with compassion.</p><p>As you think about what you need, keep it positive—what you doneed as opposed to what you don’tneed or want.
Also, try to make that positive need as specific as you can so it’s like a recipe for success with you.
For example, “I would like you to respect me” isn’t as good as, “I would like you to turn off your electronic devices
at dinner so we can just talk to each other.”</p><p>练习</p><p>我们都有问题</p><p>我们创建了一个包含25个主题的列表，这些主题可能代表您个性上的根本差异，可能会引发冲突，或者代表您生活方式需求上的根本差异，也可能成为冲突的源头。
生活方式需求对于您的身份和个人特质来说是基本的。</p><p>这个练习是一个机会，可以以新的方式了解彼此，并对在您的关系中可能引发冲突的潜在因素感到好奇。仔细审查每个项目。选择其中三到五个对您来说最重要的问题。
写下您对所选择问题的感受。您是否认为这是目前的重大冲突？您是否认为它将成为未来的冲突源？您将在约会中讨论这些问题，所以请花些时间考虑这些话题。
一些情侣选择探索每个话题，并写下他们对每个领域的感受。根据您的情况来决定做什么。</p><p>请记住，您最终是在寻求对伴侣内心世界的理解，并共同创造共同的意义。如果准时对您的伴侣很重要，而您认为准时是指迟到不超过一小时，
讨论一下为什么准时对双方来说如此重要或不重要。每个强烈情感下面通常都有一个故事。准备好相互分享自己的故事，并寻求理解，
这将有助于您以富有技巧和同情心地处理冲突。</p><p>在思考自己的需求时，保持积极——关注您所需要的，而不是您不需要或不想要的。此外，尽量让这些积极需求具体化，就像是对成功的具体配方。
例如，“我希望您尊重我”并不如“我希望您在晚餐时关闭电子设备，这样我们可以专心交谈”。</p><p>EXPLORE AND BE READY TO DISCUSS.</p><p>How are we the same and how are we different?</p><p>How can we accommodate and accept the differences between us?</p><p>Are there differences we cannot accept?</p><p>1 Differences in neatness and organization.</p><p>One person may be neat and organized, while the other is more disorganized and doesn’t mind a bit of mess.</p><p>2 Differences in punctuality.</p><p>One person is always on time or early, and the other is more casual about time, and often late.</p><p>3 Differences in doing tasks and getting things done.</p><p>One person may be a multitasker, doing lots of things at the same time, and the other likes to focus on one thing at a time.</p><p>4 Differences in emotionality.</p><p>One person is very emotionally expressive and the other is not so expressive.
One person might value exploring one’s emotions more than the other,

All couples have perpetual problems, and these account for 69 percent of conflicts.
Perpetual problems can become gridlocked problems, and when partners feel criticized, rejected,
or unaccepted by the other partner, this can be a sign you’ve entered into gridlock.</p><p>Approach your differences with curiosity rather than correctness.
Have a genuine desire to understand the stories that are underneath the issues.</p><p>The Date: ADDRESSING CONFLICT</p><p>速配</p><p>章节摘要</p><p>冲突在每个关系和婚姻中都会发生，而在一段幸福的关系中，你不可能一直和谐相处，这是一个谬误。</p><p>关系冲突是一个了解伴侣更多，并在谈论和解决差异中建立更深层亲密关系的机会。</p><p>冲突分为两种类型：</p><p>~ 可解决的问题是情境性的，涉及具体话题。通常情况下，冲突并没有更深层的意义或者一个人的立场。</p><p>~ 永恒的问题是你们个性或生活方式需求的根本差异。所有的夫妻都会有永恒的问题，这些问题占据了冲突的69％。
永恒的问题可能会变成僵局，当伴侣感到被批评、被拒绝或者被对方不接受时，这可能是你们陷入僵局的迹象。</p><p>以好奇心而不是正确性的方式看待你们的差异。真诚地希望了解问题背后的故事。</p><p>CONVERSATION TOPIC</p><p>How do we manage conflict? How are we the same and how are we different?
How do we accommodate and accept the differences between us?</p><p>PREPARATION</p><p>Review the topics and your answers from the issues exercise.
Reflect on what you read in this chapter and any ideas it sparked about how you’ve managed conflict
and how you would like to manage conflict in the future.</p><p>LOCATION</p><p>The partner that didn’t plan the first date will plan this one. For this date,
it’s best to go to a place where you can speak privately. Find a location that is peaceful to both of you,
or a place where you have had a great time together in the past.</p><p>SUGGESTIONSA</p><p>picnic in a favorite park, or a beach, or even in your own backyard.
If you have this conversation over a meal at a restaurant, make sure you have plenty of time and privacy.
An afternoon date may be preferable to an evening date, so that no one is too tired or low on energy.</p><p>对话话题</p><p>我们如何处理冲突？我们在哪些方面相同，又在哪些方面不同？我们如何容纳和接受我们之间的差异？</p><p>准备工作</p><p>回顾问题练习中的话题和您的回答。思考一下本章内容以及它对您如何处理冲突以及未来如何处理冲突的想法。</p><p>地点</p><p>由没有计划第一次约会的伴侣来计划这次约会。对于这次约会，最好选择一个可以私下交谈的地方。找一个对你们两个人都平静宜人的地方，
或者是你们过去一起度过美好时光的地方。</p><p>建议</p><p>在最喜欢的公园、海滩或甚至自己的后院野餐。如果您选择在餐厅用餐时进行这次对话，请确保有足够的时间和隐私。下午的约会可能比晚上更好，
这样没有人会太疲劳或精力不足。</p><p>AT-HOME DATE:</p><p>You may also choose to have this date while on a walk together around the neighborhood.
Even if you get stuck in your conversation, you’re still moving. And even if you disagree,
you’re still headed in the same direction together.
Hold hands while walking and while talking about something that is or was difficult between you.
See how it feels to hold on to each other while discussing how you manage conflict.</p><p>BRING</p><p>You should bring the differences you chose in the exercise, and be prepared to read or openly listen
to your partner’s answers and discuss.</p><p>在家约会：</p><p>您还可以选择在附近散步时进行这次约会。即使你在谈话中陷入困境，你们仍在移动。即使你们意见不合，你们仍然一起朝着同一个方向前进。
手牵手一起散步，同时谈论你们之间的某个或过去的一些困难之处。感受一下在讨论如何处理冲突时彼此紧握的感觉。</p><p>携带物品</p><p>您应该携带在练习中选择的差异，并准备阅读或公开倾听伴侣的答案并进行讨论。</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING</p><p>Don’t make your partner the bad guy. There is no winner in a healthy conflict;
there is only understanding and resolution or acceptance.</p><p>Communicate a fundamental acceptance of your partner’s personality, regardless of how you’re different.</p><p>Don’t avoid conflict. Avoiding conflict breeds emotional distance.</p><p>Don’t criticize or judge your partner, or believe that their viewpoint is wrong and yours is right.
Both of your perspectives are valid.</p><p>When regrettable incidents happen, use the four steps to process and repair your fight.</p><p>Love your partner for who they are, as they are.</p><p>Recognize when a problem is solvable and when it’s not. Not all conflict can, or needs to, be resolved.</p><p>OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DATE CONVERSATION</p><p>Discuss each item you chose from the issues exercise.
Some of the couples that went on this date chose to explore every issue. Take turns as both speaker and listener.
When it’s your turn to listen, ask each other the following three questions for any topics you both see
as a source of conflict or difference between you.</p><p>故障排除</p><p>不要把你的伴侣当作坏人。在健康的冲突中，没有胜利者，只有理解、解决或接受。</p><p>基本上接受你的伴侣的个性，不论你们有多么不同。</p><p>不要回避冲突。回避冲突会导致情感距离。</p><p>不要批评或评判你的伴侣，也不要认为他们的观点是错误的而你的观点是正确的。你们两个人的观点都是有效的。</p><p>当发生令人遗憾的事件时，使用四个步骤来处理和修复你们的争吵。</p><p>爱你的伴侣，爱他们现在的样子。</p><p>认识到问题何时可以解决，何时不能。不是所有的冲突都可以或需要解决。</p><p>开放性问题，用于你们的约会对话</p><p>讨论你们在问题练习中选择的每个项目。一些参加这次约会的夫妻选择探索每个问题。轮流作为发言者和倾听者。
当轮到你倾听时，针对你们彼此认为是冲突或差异来源的任何话题，互相问对方以下三个问题。</p><p>1 What is the story of how this issue is important to you?</p><p>2 Is there a story behind this issue related to your own personal history or your family growing up?</p><p>3 Is there a deeper purpose or goal for you in your position on this issue?</p><p>OTHER OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT CONFLICT:</p><p>1 How was conflict handled in your family growing up?</p><p>2 How do you feel about anger? How was it expressed in your family growing up?</p><p>3 How can I best support you when you’re feeling angry?</p><p>4 How do you like to make up after a disagreement?</p><p>5 What do you nowunderstand about your partner that you didn’t before this exercise?</p><p>AFFIRMING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER</p><p>Take turns reading this affirmation out loud to each other. Maintain eye contact while reciting.</p><p>I commit to accepting you completely and embracing our differences. When we have conflict,
I’ll seek to understand your feelings and point of view about the issue,
and will manage our conflict as skillfully as possible. When regrettable incidents happen,
I’ll seek to repair the damage through the process we have discussed.</p><p>1 这个问题对你来说有什么重要性的故事是什么？</p><p>2 这个问题背后是否有与你个人历史或成长环境有关的故事？</p><p>3 在这个问题上，你的立场是否有更深层的目的或目标？</p><p>其他关于冲突的开放性问题：</p><p>1 你在成长过程中家庭是如何处理冲突的？</p><p>2 你对愤怒有什么感受？在你成长的家庭中，愤怒是如何表达的？</p><p>3 在你感到愤怒时，我如何最好地支持你？</p><p>4 在发生争论后，你喜欢如何和解？</p><p>5 通过这个练习，你对你的伴侣有了什么新的理解？</p><p>向未来的肯定</p><p>轮流大声向对方朗读这个肯定句。在朗读时保持眼神交流。</p><p>我承诺完全接受你并拥抱我们的差异。当我们有冲突时，我将努力理解你在这个问题上的感受和观点，并尽可能熟练地处理我们的冲突。

“You don’t usually think of engineers and computer science people as particularly sexy, ” said Katya,
“but I love talking about sex! There’s nothing that I’m uncomfortable talking about. I’m like my grandmother that way.
She will just as easily discuss blow jobs as she will where she’s going on her next cruise.
I always thought that was totally normal, until I met Ethan.”</p><p>Katya和Ethan结婚已经将近一年了，两人在同一家科技公司工作，并且都每天工作很长时间。Katya说：“通常人们不会认为工程师和计算机科学人员特别性感，
但我喜欢谈论性！没有什么话题让我感到不舒服。在这方面，我像我的祖母一样。她可以轻松地讨论口交，就像她会谈论下一次巡航旅行的目的地一样。
我一直以为这是完全正常的，直到我遇到了Ethan。”</p><p>To say Ethan grew up in a more conservative home than Katya would be an understatement.
“When I was about seventeen, we had the talk,” he said.
“It was super awkward, and my dad just kind of asked me if I knew about protection and that was it.
You could tell he was uncomfortable and that made me uncomfortable. I was a virgin until I was twenty-one.
My parents didn’t talk about sex.
I mean the only signs that my parents were sexual in any way was the fact that there was me and my two brothers.
Other than that, whatever they did sexually they did in the bedroom and they did it quietly.
We had a really small house. I don’t think I ever even saw them make out, I mean, an occasional peck here and there,
but no real passion.”</p><p>// todo</p><p>说伊桑在一个比卡蒂娅更保守的家庭长大简直是个轻描淡写。他说：“我大约十七岁的时候，我们进行了那个谈话。”
“那真是非常尴尬，我爸爸只是随口问了一句我是否知道保护措施，然后就结束了。你可以感觉到他很不自在，这也让我感到不自在。我直到21岁都是处男。
我父母从不谈论性。我的意思是，我父母在性方面唯一的迹象就是我和我两个兄弟的存在。除此之外，无论他们在性方面做什么，他们都在卧室里进行，并且保持安静。
我们的房子很小。我想我从未见过他们亲热，我的意思是，偶尔会亲吻一下，但没有真正的激情。</p><p>For Katya, the sex date was a way to get them to open up about what they both liked and didn’t like in their lovemaking.
“It gave us a good framework to have a real talk. Because there were specific questions written by someone else
who doesn’t know us, it allowed us to make them our own—and it let us get really personal.”</p><p>When Katya and Ethan first started dating, they had instant chemistry. “It was off the charts,” said Katya,
“It kind of startled me, because he was this real studious kind of guy. Super nerdy, which I think is sexy,
and we went on a hike and the whole time I just wanted to jump him.
The attraction was so strong I wasn’t even listening to him—I don’t think he even knew it—and it scared me a little
because I had never felt that way before.”</p><p>“I knew it,” said Ethan. “You were practically drooling on me.”</p><p>“That attraction actually made me wait longer than I had before to have sex. I knew he was a game changer.
We waited a month, but that felt like a long time because we were together almost every day.
I knew that he was someone who was going to change my life—not just someone I was dating or
a boyfriend or a lover—he was the real deal. I loved that month of anticipation. It was like one long big tease,
and when we did finally have sex   .  .  . kapok! It was everything.”</p><p>“I don’t like to think about all the guys she didn’t wait with. Katya is way more sexually experienced than I am,
and that was hard for me at first. I always wondered if she wanted me to do things to her that I didn’t even know about.
I don’t watch porn. I’ve never read a sex book. It’s not my most confident area.
If sex were coding, I would become an expert easily, but it’s not. Women were kind of mysterious to me.
Katya is still mysterious to me.”</p><p>“Me, or my vagina?”</p><p>“Both!” Ethan laughed. “You see, that’s what I’m talking about. You are way more open in how you talk and I love it.
It helps me be more open and feel more comfortable. I think my dad would pass out if you said the word vaginato him.
Literally drop to the floor.”</p><p>“It’s kind of this weird role reversal, because there’s a stereotype that women are the innocent virgins
and the man guides them sexually, but I love that you’ve let me teach you and show you what I like.
I know it’s hard for you to tell me what you like or don’t like, but I want to know what turns you on the most.”</p><p>“It all turns me on.”</p><p>“That’s easy to say, but I really want to know specifically.
I really want us to be able to talk about anything sexually. I have no idea if you have any fantasies.
I would totally love to act out a fantasy you have. Seriously. Anything.”</p><p>对于Katya来说，性爱约会是一个让他们敞开心扉，谈论彼此喜欢和不喜欢的性爱方式的方式。“它为我们提供了一个良好的框架来进行真实的交谈。
因为这是由不认识我们的其他人写的具体问题，它让我们能够将它们变成我们自己的问题，并且让我们变得非常私人。”</p><p>当Katya和Ethan刚开始约会时，他们之间立即产生了化学反应。“那种感觉超出了尺度，”Katya说，“有点吓到我，因为他是个非常用功的人。
超级书呆子，我觉得这很性感，我们一起去远足，整个时间我只想扑到他身上。
吸引力是如此强烈，我甚至都没在听他说话——我觉得他甚至没有意识到——这有点吓到我，因为我以前从未有过这种感觉。”</p><p>“我就知道，”Ethan说。“你简直快要对我流口水了。”</p><p>“这种吸引力实际上使我等待比以前更长时间才发生性关系。我知道他是个改变游戏规则的人。
我们等了一个月，但因为我们几乎每天在一起，所以感觉像很长一段时间。我知道他是一个将改变我的生活的人——不只是我约会的人，或者男朋友，
或者情人——他是真正的事实。我喜欢那一个月的期待。就像一个长时间的挑逗，当我们最终发生性关系时……砰！那是一切。”</p><p>“我不想想她和多少个人没有等待。Katya在性方面的经验比我多得多，一开始这对我来说很困难。我总是想知道她是否希望我做我根本不知道的事情。我不看色情片。
我从未读过性方面的书籍。这不是我最自信的领域。如果性爱就像编码，我会轻松成为专家，但它不是。女人对我来说有点神秘。Katya对我来说仍然是神秘的。”</p><p>“是我，还是我的阴道？”</p><p>“两者都是！”Ethan笑了起来。“你看，这就是我说的。你在谈话方式上更加开放，我喜欢。这帮助我更加开放和感到更舒服。
我想我爸听到你对他说阴道这个词，肯定会昏过去。真的会晕倒。”</p><p>“这有点奇怪的角色转换，因为有一种刻板印象认为女性是无辜的处女，而男人在性方面引导她们，但我喜欢你让我来教导你，展示我喜欢的方式。
我知道你很难告诉我你喜欢或不喜欢什么，但我想知道最能激发你的是什么。”</p><p>“所有都能激发我。”</p><p>“那很容易说，但我真的想了解具体的内容。我真的希望我们能够在性方面畅所欲言。我不知道你是否有任何幻想。我会非常愿意实现你的幻想。真的。无论什么。”</p><p>“Anything?”</p><p>“Anything!”</p><p>Grace and Mia are a same-sex unmarried couple who have been together for a little over a year,
and were deciding whether to move in together when they went on the Sex &amp; Intimacy date.
“We both work seventy hours a week sometimes, so on nights we spend together we just fall asleep rather than make love.
But we’re working on it,” said Grace. “I mean we used to have sex like three or four times a week,
but now we cuddle a lot and pass out.”</p><p>“Is that a problem for you?” asked Mia.</p><p>“I think as long as we’re having sex at least once a week, I’m okay.
I’m going to try to work only fifty hours a week. What about you?”</p><p>“If we go two weeks without sex,” laughed Mia, “we’re going to need to talk.”</p><p>“I’m going to talk to you, too, if we go that long.”</p><p>Grace and Mia were comfortable and playful talking about what they like and don’t like sexually.
“We try lots of new positions and angles when we make love,” said Mia. “It’s fun.
I like it when we are slow and sensual, and really connected. That makes me feel loved.
That and when you tell me you love me. I feel the most loved when you are telling me and showing me.”</p><p>Both Mia and Grace expressed concern about the frequency of sex,
and Grace expressed concern about the creativity of their sex life.
“Sometimes it’s like we just do the same old routine, and I’d like to try new things.”</p><p>“什么都可以吗？”</p><p>“什么都可以！”</p><p>Grace和Mia是一对同性未婚伴侣，他们在一起时间有一年多了，当他们进行性与亲密关系的约会时，他们正在考虑是否搬到一起。
“有时我们每周都要工作七十个小时，所以在我们在一起的晚上，我们只是睡着了，而不是做爱。但我们正在努力改善，”Grace说。
“我的意思是，我们以前每周大约做爱三四次，但现在我们大多数时间都在拥抱睡着。”</p><p>“这对你来说是个问题吗？”Mia问。</p><p>“只要我们每周至少有一次性生活，我就可以接受。我打算每周只工作五十个小时。你呢？”</p><p>“如果我们两周没有性生活，”Mia笑着说，“我们需要谈一谈。”</p><p>“如果我们那么久没有性生活，我也会和你谈的。”</p><p>Grace和Mia在谈论自己的性爱偏好时感到舒适和愉快。“我们在做爱时尝试很多新的姿势和角度，”Mia说。“很有趣。我喜欢我们缓慢而情感丰富，真正地融为一体。
那让我感到被爱。还有当你告诉我你爱我时。当你告诉我并向我展示时，我感受到最深的爱。”</p><p>Mia和Grace都对性生活的频率表示担忧，而Grace则对他们的性生活创意表示担忧。“有时候感觉我们只是重复同样的老套路，我想尝试新的事物。”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like combining yoga and sex. Or even acro-yoga, where you hang upside down.
I want to see if we can add more spirituality into our lovemaking. Work with energy. That really interests me.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you wanted to do that.”</p><p>“We’re both pretty flexible, so I think it would be fun.
And if we fall on our faces doing acro-yoga sex, at least we tried!”</p><p>“It will definitely make a good story!”</p><p>Matthew and Erin have a nine-month-old baby, and have been married for three years and together for nine.
“It’s hard to find the energy, or the time,” says Erin. “I miss how spontaneous we used to be with sex.
I loved that one time at the beach on vacation.”</p><p>“That was pretty public, even though we were in the water,” said Matthew.
“I don’t know if anyone even knew what we were doing, but that made it more exciting.”</p><p>“It was amazing,” said Erin.</p><p>&quot;比如什么？&quot;</p><p>&quot;比如结合瑜伽和性爱。甚至是空中瑜伽，你倒挂起来。我想看看我们是否能在性爱中加入更多的灵性。运用能量。这真的很吸引我。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我不知道你想做那些事情。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我们俩都很灵活，所以我觉得会很有趣。如果我们在做空中瑜伽性爱时摔倒在地，至少我们尝试过了！&quot;</p><p>&quot;这肯定会成为一个有趣的故事！&quot;</p><p>Matthew和Erin有一个九个月大的宝宝，他们结婚三年，一起已经九年了。“很难找到精力或时间，”Erin说。“我怀念我们以前对性爱的自发性。
我喜欢那次在度假时在海滩上的经历。”</p><p>&quot;那真的很公开，即使我们在水中，&quot;Matthew说道。“我不知道是否有人知道我们在做什么，但这让它变得更加刺激。”</p><p>&quot;那真是太棒了，&quot;Erin说。</p><p>Matthew responded, “I guess I want to know how I can help you feel more spontaneous.
That’s what having a baby does—here I am trying to plan our spontaneity.
But I know you’re tired and the baby demands a lot of your time and attention and energy.”</p><p>Erin asked, “So do you feel neglected?”</p><p>“Not neglected,” replied Matthew, “because I know what we signed up for in becoming parents,
and I know it won’t be forever, but I do miss having more intimate time together.”</p><p>“I miss it, too. It’s just with nursing—sometimes I don’t want anything or anyone to touch me, especially my breasts.
And I’m not that confident yet with my body. But I don’t want us to lose that intimacy.
Sometimes it’s just nice to be held and, you know, comforted. That’s sexy time for me right now.
We waited so long to have this baby, and now I’m tired a lot of the time.
I should have had a baby at twenty-four, not thirty-four!”</p><p>“You’re gorgeous to me, and I will try to help you more, so you can be more rested.”</p><p>“And have more sex?” laughed Erin.</p><p>Matthew replied, “Well, yeah, I won’t complain if that happens.”</p><p>“It helps to talk about how things have changed. Sometimes I worry about it,
and I wonder if you’re going to leave me for some younger woman who isn’t tired all the time and can have sex
four times a day.”</p><p>“Seriously?” said Matthew.</p><p>Matthew回答说：“我想我想知道我如何帮助你感受到更多的自发性。这就是有了孩子之后的情况 - 我在试图计划我们的自发性。
但我知道你很累，宝宝需要你很多时间、关注和精力。”</p><p>Erin问道：“那你觉得被忽视了吗？”</p><p>Matthew回答：“不是被忽视了，因为我知道我们成为父母时签下了什么，而且我知道这不会是永远，但我确实想念我们有更多亲密时间在一起。”</p><p>“我也很想念。只是喂奶的时候 - 有时候我不想让任何人或任何东西碰我，尤其是我的乳房。而且我对我的身体还没有那么自信。但我不想让我们失去那种亲密感。
有时候只是被拥抱，你知道的，得到安慰，那对我来说就是性感的时刻。我们等了这么久才有了这个孩子，现在我很多时候都很累。我应该在二十四岁的时候生孩子，
而不是三十四岁！”</p><p>“对我来说，你是美丽动人的，我会努力帮助你，让你能够更加休息。”</p><p>“然后会有更多性爱吗？”Erin笑着问道。</p><p>Matthew回答：“嗯，是的，如果发生了，我不会抱怨。”</p><p>“谈论事物如何改变真的有帮助。有时候我会担心，我想知道你是否会因为一些年轻女人没有那么累，每天可以做四次性爱而离开我。”</p><p>“说真的？”Matthew说道。</p><p>Erin replied, “Yes, but part of it’s hormonal.”</p><p>“I can go without sex, but I still want to feel connected as a couple and not just as parents.
I want to kiss and flirt with you. I want you to tell me how sexy and handsome I am to you.
I would never leave you for a younger woman who could have sex four times a day. I promise.”</p><p>“She’d probably be a total bitch, anyway.”</p><p>“Probably,” said Matthew</p><p>Erin thought about it for a moment. “So what if we just make it a point to make each other feel more loved during the day,
when there’s no pressure to have sex or not have sex; it will help me not feel so stressed about whether
I’m letting you down in that area. Maybe like just a text message here and there,
so I start feeling less like a milking machine and more like the Erin on the beach.”</p><p>“I can sext you so hard!” laughed Matthew.</p><p>“Ooh! See, it’s working already.”</p><p>Erin回答说：“是的，但其中一部分是荷尔蒙的作用。”</p><p>“我可以没有性爱，但我仍然希望感受到我们作为夫妻之间的联系，而不仅仅是作为父母。我想要亲吻和调情。我希望你告诉我你对我有多么性感和帅气。
我绝不会为了一个每天可以进行四次性爱的年轻女人而离开你。我保证。”</p><p>“她可能也会变成一个彻头彻尾的婊子。”</p><p>“可能吧，”Matthew说道。</p><p>Erin沉思了一会儿。“那我们是否可以在白天更多地让彼此感受到爱，不管是否发生性行为，这样我就不会那么担心是否在这方面让你失望了。
也许就是发送一条短信，这样我就能感受到不再像一个挤奶机，而更像海滩上的Erin。”</p><p>“我可以给你发送超级辣的性感短信！”Matthew笑着说。</p><p>“哦！看吧，现在就有效果了。”</p><p>For all the couples that shared their sex date conversations with us, humor was a big part of the discussion.
Talking about sex doesn’t have to be uncomfortable or awkward or serious.
Approach this conversation and date with lightness and honesty.
One engaged couple that had chosen to be celibate until marriage laughed throughout the conversation,
but still found it enlightening to talk about sex before they had actually had sex.
“It was fun. We just applied it to the things we had done sexually with each other.
We’re celibate and virgins, but we’re not monks or anything.
Laughing about sex makes it less serious and less stressful.
And it was a good way to get the conversation going even before we get married.
The one thing we had no idea about was how frequently we are going to want to have sex.
Like, we have no idea what’s really normal in that area for us.”</p><p>对于所有与我们分享他们的性爱约会对话的夫妇来说，幽默是讨论的重要组成部分。谈论性爱并不一定不舒服、尴尬或严肃。
以轻松和诚实的态度对待这次对话和约会。一对选择在婚姻之前守贞的订婚夫妇在整个对话中都笑个不停，但仍然发现在实际发生性行为之前谈论性爱是令人开悟的。
“那很有趣。我们只是将它应用到我们之间已经做过的性行为上。我们虽然守贞并且是处男处女，但我们并不像和尚那样。开玩笑谈论性爱使其变得不那么严肃和紧张。
而且这是一个在我们结婚之前就让对话开始的好方法。我们唯一不清楚的是我们想要多频繁地发生性行为。就像，我们不知道对我们来说在这方面什么才是真正的正常。”</p><p>FINDING YOUR NORMAL</p><p>We all wonder about other couples. How much sex are they having? How does our sex life compare?
What if sex isn’t that big a deal to us? Or what if we’ve chosen to be celibate?
If we’re not having sex very often, or if the sex drops off, does that mean our relationship is doomed?
What about fantasy and role-play? Oral sex? Anal sex? And how much sex is “normal” in a long-term relationship?</p><p>寻找你们的正常状态</p><p>我们都会对其他夫妻感到好奇。他们的性生活有多频繁？我们的性生活与他们相比如何？如果性对我们来说并不是那么重要，怎么办？
或者我们选择了独身主义？如果我们的性生活并不频繁，或者性爱减少了，这是否意味着我们的关系注定要失败？幻想和角色扮演呢？
口交？肛交？在长期关系中，&quot;正常&quot;的性生活频率是多少呢？</p><p>What’s normal is whatever works for you and your partner. According to a comprehensive University of Chicago study,
80 percent of married couples have sex a few times a month or more,
with 32 percent of those reporting having sex two to three times per week,
and 48 percent reporting having sex a few times per month.
It’s a myth that sex is or should be deeply romantic, with lit candles, soft music, and hours of leisurely lovemaking.
Real couples may occasionally have sex for a long time, or they may have quickies more often.
There may be fantasy and role-play, sex toys, and even some things you couldn’t imagine your best friends doing.
Normal is whatever you both are comfortable with, and normal will change often throughout the life
of your relationship—as you have children, as you age, as you deal with medical issues.
It’s all a normal part of human sexuality, and it’s all okay.
To begin your relationship or marriage saying we’re going to have sex every single day is a setup for failure.
Life shows up, and nothing is a greater measure of just how life is showing up than your sexuality.</p><p>每对夫妇的正常状态是与他们的伴侣相适应的状态。根据芝加哥大学的一项综合研究，80%的已婚夫妇每月至少有几次性生活，
其中32%的夫妇表示每周有两到三次性生活，48%的夫妇表示每月有几次性生活。
性爱应该是或者应该变得浪漫、点燃蜡烛、轻柔音乐和几小时的悠闲性爱，这是一个谬误。真实的夫妇可能偶尔有长时间的性爱，或者更经常进行快速性行为。
可能会有幻想和角色扮演，性玩具，甚至一些你无法想象你最好的朋友会做的事情。
正常是你们两个都感到舒适的状态，而正常状态在你们的关系中会经常发生变化——当你们有了孩子，随着年龄增长，处理医疗问题。
这都是人类性欲的正常部分，而且都没问题。在开始你们的关系或婚姻时说我们每天都要进行性爱是注定会失败的。
生活在你们面前展现出来，而你们的性生活是衡量生活展现方式的重要指标。</p><p>We all want to keep our relationship passionate and connected, and there are ways to both create and
destroy your connection that all take place out of the bedroom.
What’s most important is not to let sex become the last item on a very long to-do list,
the final obligation you turn to when you’re both exhausted.
There are concrete ways to ensure you have a great sex life.</p><p>In a study of 70,000 responses from 24 different countries, Christianne Northrup, Pepper Schwartz, and James Witte,

和詹姆斯·维特（James Witte）在他们的书《The Normal Bar》中报告了他们关于爱情和性生活的广泛调查结果。拥有美好性生活的夫妇会：</p><p>每天对伴侣说“我爱你”，并真心实意地说出来。</p><p>Buy one another surprise romantic gifts</p><p>Compliment their partner often</p><p>Have romantic vacations</p><p>Give one another back rubs</p><p>Kiss one another passionately for no reason at all (85 percent who love sex also kiss passionately)</p><p>Show affection publicly (hold hands, caress, kiss)</p><p>Cuddle with one another every day (only 6 percent of the non-cuddlers had a great sex life)</p><p>Have a romantic date once a week that may include dressing up, dinner out, massage, and lovemaking</p><p>Make sex a priority and talk to one another about sex comfortably</p><p>Are open to a variety of sexual activities</p><p>Turn toward bids for emotional connection</p><p>Furthermore, the more couples do these things, the better their sex life is. The champion countries were Spain and Italy.
The bottom line: Great sex is not rocket science.
It’s very doable, but you have to be able to talk about it and you have to make it a priority in your relationship.</p><p>彼此购买惊喜的浪漫礼物</p><p>经常赞美对方</p><p>进行浪漫的度假</p><p>互相给对方按摩</p><p>无缘无故地热吻对方（85%喜欢性爱的人也会热吻）</p><p>公开展示爱意（牵手、轻抚、亲吻）</p><p>每天拥抱在一起（只有6%不拥抱的人拥有良好的性生活）</p><p>每周安排一次浪漫约会，可能包括盛装出席、外出晚餐、按摩和性爱</p><p>把性爱放在优先位置，并能够舒适地与对方谈论性爱</p><p>对各种性活动持开放态度</p><p>积极回应对情感连接的邀请</p><p>此外，夫妇们越是做这些事情，他们的性生活就会越好。冠军国家是西班牙和意大利。最重要的是：伟大的性生活并不是什么难事。
这是完全可行的，但你必须能够谈论它，并将其作为你们关系的优先事项。</p><p>SEX AFTER PARENTHOOD</p><p>A study done on dual-career couples by the UCLA Sloane Center for Everyday Life of Families found that couples
with young children tended to spend very little time with one another.
Much like Matthew and Erin, these couples were alone together in a typical evening only 10 percent of the time.
Typically dads were in rooms alone, while mom was alone with the kids.
One researcher in this study told us that the dual-career couples talked to one another an average of 35 minutes a week,
and most of that talk was about errands.
Therefore, many couples eventually stop doing the romantic things with one another that sustain a loving relationship.
They stop having fun. They stop making time for playfulness. They stop having romantic getaways or romantic dates.
They stop having adventures together. They stop doing all the things that sustain passion and a lively romantic life.
Instead, their lives become an infinite list of errands, and life becomes drudgery.</p><p>None of that is necessary, especially when kids arrive.
The greatest gift a couple can give their kids is a loving relationship they can model and grow within.
The children are nurtured by the love between the parents as much as by the love they receive directly.</p><p>育儿之后的性生活</p><p>由加州大学洛杉矶分校斯隆家庭日常生活研究中心对双职业夫妇进行的一项研究发现，有孩子的夫妇往往在一起度过的时间非常少。
就像马修和艾琳一样，这些夫妇在一个典型的晚上只有10％的时间是独处。通常情况下，爸爸独自呆在房间里，而妈妈则独自与孩子在一起。
这项研究中的一位研究人员告诉我们，双职业夫妇每周彼此交流的平均时间只有35分钟，而且大部分谈话都是关于杂事。
因此，许多夫妇最终停止了彼此之间维系爱情关系的浪漫行为。他们停止了享乐。他们不再为玩耍腾出时间。他们停止了浪漫的度假或约会。
他们不再一起冒险。他们停止了所有维系激情和活跃的浪漫生活的事情。相反，他们的生活变成了一份无休止的琐事清单，生活变得乏味。</p><p>然而，所有这些都是不必要的，特别是当孩子出生后。夫妇可以给孩子们最好的礼物就是一个他们可以模仿和成长的充满爱的关系。
孩子们通过父母之间的爱情得到滋养，这种爱情对他们的成长和发展同样重要。</p><p>TALKING ABOUT SEX</p><p>This date is all about discussing your sex life, and creating your own rituals of connection.
To do that, however, you need to be able to talk about sex.
Research shows that couples who can talk openly about sex have more sex,
and the women in these relationships have more orgasms. Talking about sex is a win-win for couples.
Even with the knowledge that just talking about sex creates more sex (and more satisfying sex),
it can still be difficult. Only a minority of couples can speak openly and freely about sex.
But this is a skill you can learn and get more and more comfortable with.
The important thing when you’re talking about sex with your partner is to focus on what you like and what feels good.
“I like it when you touch me here.   .  .  . It feels so good when you do   .  .  .”
This is especially important for women to feel comfortable doing,
because research shows that men need and want some guidance.
Men want to bring their partner pleasure, they want to satisfy them sexually, and they want some direction.</p><p>Another key point to talking about what’s working and not working in your sex life is to discuss it outside the bedroom.
Stopping things in the middle of the action to offer constructive criticism is not going to go over well,
for either of you. One couple we know like to do what they call “sex review” after the fact.
This usually happens the next morning over coffee, or even while they’re out running errands.
“We talk about what we liked. What we want to try the next time we make love. New moves and things that were surprising.
Anything, really. Sex review is a way to keep things sexy even when we’re not doing sexy things.”</p><p>This particular couple used a lot of humor to discuss what was working and good for each of them in their sex life.
These discussions were always positive, and there was never a “bad” review. They talked about only what they liked.
All of the conversations in this book ask you to be honest, open, and vulnerable with your partner and this can
and will feel uncomfortable, but discussing sex can bring that vulnerability to an entirely different level.
Often it can seem easier to be naked physically rather than naked emotionally,
but if you want to create a relationship or marriage that goes the distance, you’re going to have to bare it all.</p><p>谈论性爱</p><p>这次约会的目的是讨论你们的性生活，并创造属于你们自己的亲密仪式。然而，要做到这一点，你需要能够谈论性爱。研究显示，
能够坦诚地谈论性爱的夫妻性生活更丰富，而女性在这些关系中也更容易获得高潮。谈论性爱对夫妻双方都是双赢的。
即使知道仅仅谈论性爱就会带来更多的性活动（以及更令人满意的性爱），但谈论性爱仍然可能会有困难。只有少数夫妻能够公开自由地谈论性爱。
但这是一项你可以学习并逐渐变得更加自如的技能。当你与伴侣谈论性爱时，重要的是关注你喜欢什么和什么让你感觉良好。
“我喜欢你在这里触摸我……你这样做感觉太好了……”这对于女性来说尤其重要，因为研究表明男性需要并希望一些指导。
男性希望给伴侣带来快乐，满足她们的性需求，并希望得到一些指引。</p><p>另一个谈论你们性生活中什么有效和什么无效的关键是在卧室之外进行讨论。在行房中间停下来提供建设性的批评对你们两个人都不会产生良好的效果。
我们认识的一对夫妻喜欢在事后进行所谓的“性爱回顾”。这通常发生在第二天早上喝咖啡时，甚至在外出办事时。“我们谈论我们喜欢的事情。
我们想在下次做爱时尝试的事情。新的动作和令人惊喜的事情。其实什么都可以。性爱回顾是在我们没有进行性行为时保持性感的一种方式。”</p><p>这对夫妻在讨论他们的性生活中使用了很多幽默感。这些讨论始终积极向上，从来没有“不好”的回顾。他们只谈论他们喜欢的事情。
本书中的所有对话都要求你与伴侣保持诚实、开放和脆弱，这可能会感到不舒服，但讨论性爱会让这种脆弱感达到一个全新的层次。
通常来说，在身体上裸露似乎比在情感上裸露更容易，但如果你想建立一段长久的关系或婚姻，你将不得不全身心地展示自己。</p><p>INITIATING SEX</p><p>Research shows that over 70 percent of people (both men and women) use indirect strategies to ask for sex.
A direct method would be, “Hey, sweetheart, let’s make love.” “I want sex.”
“Do you want sex?” But only 30 percent of couples, married or otherwise, use this direct approach.
Most people will indicate they want to make love with a touch, a cuddle, or a kiss,
and they will do so in what we call a face-saving way. Meaning they will go in for a kiss or a cuddle,
see what the response is, and proceed accordingly. It’s a way to test the waters and avoid getting rejected.
Nobody likes rejection, especially when they are going in hot, looking for some sexy-time.
As relationships mature, the bids for affection and sex will get more direct.
And that’s a good thing, because there’s less chance for misunderstanding
and hurt feelings to arise when we’re direct and loving—and sexy.</p><p>In general, there are some differences between men and women when it comes to asking for sex.
We say “in general” because there are exceptions to every rule.
We also want to acknowledge that we have cited the research available on gay and lesbian couples,
but almost none exists on transgender couples, which limits much of our citations to research on heterosexual,
cisgender couples. We are hoping this will change in the future.</p><p>犯罪</p><p>研究显示，超过70%的人（无论男性还是女性）使用间接策略来请求性行为。直接的方式可能是：“亲爱的，让我们做爱吧。”“我想要性爱。”
“你想要性爱吗？”但只有30%的夫妇（包括已婚夫妇和非婚夫妇）使用这种直接的方法。大多数人会通过触碰、拥抱或亲吻来表示他们想要做爱，
而且他们会以一种保全面子的方式进行。也就是说，他们会试探一下对方的反应，然后相应地继续。这是一种测试情况，避免被拒绝的方式。没有人喜欢被拒绝，
尤其是当他们充满激情地期待性爱时。随着关系的成熟，对爱抚和性的需求会变得更直接。这是一件好事，因为当我们直接、充满爱意和性感时，
就能减少误解和受伤的可能性。</p><p>总的来说，男性和女性在请求性行为方面有一些差异。我们说“总的来说”，因为每个规则都有例外。
我们也想承认，我们引用的研究主要涉及同性恋和女同性恋夫妇，但几乎没有关于跨性别夫妇的研究，这限制了我们对异性恋、顺性别夫妇的引用。
希望在将来这种情况能有所改变。</p><p>THINKING ABOUT SEX:</p><p>Men think about sex more than women. Fifty-four percent of men compared to 19 percent of women think about sex
every day or several times a day.</p><p>FREQUENCY:</p><p>In our research of couples’ sex lives, we found that ideally men want sex four to five times a week,
and women one to two times.</p><p>FANTASIES:</p><p>Men have more explicit sexual fantasies and women have more romantic fantasies.</p><p>关于性的思考：</p><p>男性比女性更频繁地思考性。54%的男性每天或多次每天都会思考性，而女性中只有19%会如此。</p><p>频率：</p><p>在我们对夫妇性生活的研究中，我们发现男性理想情况下希望每周进行四到五次性行为，而女性则是一到两次。</p><p>幻想：</p><p>男性有更多明确的性幻想，而女性则有更多浪漫的幻想。</p><p>MASTURBATION:</p><p>Adolescent males masturbate more than adolescent females, and this difference continues into adulthood.</p><p>PREREQUISITES FOR SEX:</p><p>Men in general like to have sex to feel emotionally connected, and women need to feel emotionally connected to have sex.
Almost 90 percent of the couples we interviewed agreed with that last sentence.
We refer to this as women having more prerequisites for sex than men do.
Women’s prerequisites aren’t always limited to emotional closeness; sometimes they are about feeling exhausted,
distracted, not rested, or not good about herself or her body.
Interestingly, the data shows that gay men have the most sex of any type of couple—twopeople with
the fewest prerequisites—and lesbians have the least sex of any type of couple—twopeople with the most prerequisites.
Sexual desire for women is a barometer for how the rest of her world is going.
If she’s not rested, or happy, or healthy, or feeling supported and loved, she’s not going to feel like having sex.</p><p>自慰：</p><p>青少年男性比青少年女性更频繁地进行自慰，而这种差异在成年后仍然存在。</p><p>性行为的先决条件：</p><p>总体而言，男性喜欢通过性行为来获得情感上的连接，而女性需要在情感上与伴侣建立连接才会进行性行为。我们采访的夫妇中，近90%的人同意上述观点。
我们将这种情况描述为女性对性行为有更多的先决条件。女性的先决条件并不总是局限于情感的亲近，有时还涉及到她感到疲倦、心烦意乱、没有休息好，
或者对自己或自己的身体感觉不好等方面。有趣的是，数据显示，同性恋男性是所有类型伴侣中性生活最频繁的，
他们的先决条件最少；而女同性恋者是所有类型伴侣中性生活最少的，她们的先决条件最多。对于女性来说，性欲是她整个世界状况的晴雨表。
如果她感到疲倦、不开心、不健康，或者感受不到支持和爱，她就不会有性欲。</p><p>SAYING YES:</p><p>Despite women having more prerequisites for sex, women agree to sex at the same rate that men do.
Psychologists Sandra Byers and Larry Heinlein had men and women keep records of their sex lives,
and found that both men and women say yes to sex about 75 percent of the time.
So regardless of who is initiating—and in their study men initiated sex more often than women—the positive response
percentage is the same.
Isn’t that an amazing figure, given how much all of us fear rejection? There’s no need to feel so worried!</p><p>同意性行为：</p><p>尽管女性对于性行为有更多的前提条件，但女性和男性同样在相同比例的情况下同意进行性行为。
心理学家桑德拉·拜尔斯（Sandra Byers）和拉里·海因莱因（Larry Heinlein）让男性和女性记录他们的性生活，
发现男性和女性在大约75%的情况下都会同意进行性行为。因此，无论是谁发起性行为（在他们的研究中，男性更经常发起性行为），积极回应的百分比是相同的。
考虑到我们都非常害怕被拒绝，这个数字是不是令人惊讶？没有必要感到如此担心！</p><p>ACCEPTING THE NO:</p><p>If your partner doesn’t want to have sex, the most important thing is to not take it personally.
In happy couples, there is no anger or defensiveness if one partner isn’t in the mood.
According to our research, each of you isn’t going to be in the mood 25 percent of the time that your partner is
in the mood. Finding a way to handle the “no” is critical to the success of your relationship.
Find ways to be affectionate and be together, even if sex has been taken off the table.
Those couples who have mastered acceptance of the no, actually end up having sex more than couples
where one partner gets upset when the other one isn’t in the mood.
A great way to respond to no is realizing that “no” does not have to end connection.
Then one can say, “Thanks for telling me you’re not in the mood. What are you in the mood for?
Do you feel like taking a walk? Watching TV? Cuddling? Just talking? Or would you like time alone?
” It’s important not to punish one’s partner for saying no. Don’t sulk or whine.
It’s especially hard for men to hear “no,”
because research shows that being wanted sexually is essential to a man’s sense of his masculinity.
There’s even been a study showing that men would prefer to get fired from their job rather than have their partner
not want them sexually. If there is a lack of physical affection, flirting, and intimate connection apart from sex,
your sex life will suffer. If there’s emotional distance or intense conflict, like we discussed in the previous chapter,
your sex life will suffer. It there’s a lack of physical or emotional safety, or if one of you doesn’t feel appreciated,
it can affect both the quality and quantity of your sex life.
Checking in on your partner’s interior world will help your sex life flourish.</p><p>接受对方的拒绝：</p><p>如果你的伴侣不想发生性关系，最重要的是不要把这个拒绝放在个人身上。在幸福的夫妻关系中，如果一方不想要性关系，不会出现愤怒或防御的情况。
根据我们的研究，每个人不在性欲状态的时间约占另一方性欲状态的25%。找到处理“不行”的方式对你们的关系成功至关重要。
即使性关系不可行，也要寻找亲昵和在一起的方式。那些接受拒绝的夫妻实际上比一方对另一方不在性欲状态感到不满的夫妻更频繁地发生性关系。
回应拒绝的一个好方式是意识到“不行”并不意味着失去联系。然后你可以说：“谢谢你告诉我你不想要。你现在想要什么？你想散步吗？看电视？拥抱一下？聊聊天？
还是你想要独处的时间？”重要的是不要因为对方说“不行”而惩罚对方。不要闷闷不乐或抱怨。
对男性来说，听到“不行”尤其困难，因为研究表明，被性欲所渴望对男性的男子气概感至关重要。
甚至有一项研究显示，男性宁愿被解雇也不愿意让伴侣不再渴望他们。如果缺乏身体的亲密、调情和除性行为外的亲密关系，你们的性生活将受到影响。
如果存在情感上的距离或激烈的冲突（正如我们在上一章中讨论的那样），你们的性生活也会受到影响。
如果缺乏身体或情感上的安全感，或者你们中的一方感觉不被欣赏，这都会影响你们的性生活的质量和数量。
关心你伴侣内心世界的状态将有助于你们的性生活蓬勃发展。</p><p>KEEPING IT PASSIONATE</p><p>There’s one simple way to keep the passion flowing in your relationship—kiss. Kiss a lot. Kiss often.
Kiss each time you leave each other, and each time you see each other again after being apart.
And we’re not talking about a peck on the lips like you would give your grandmother;
we recommend a juicy, 6-second kiss that would make your grandmother—or anyone else watching the two of you—blush.
When you kiss passionately, you set off a chemical cascade of hormones and neurotransmitters that release dopamine
and increase oxytocin, both of which make you feel good. Really good. If you really mean it when you kiss,
your blood vessels will dilate, your brain will receive extra oxygen, your pupils will dilate,
and your cheeks will flush. Lips are our body’s most exposed erogenous zone and are associated
with a disproportionately large part of the brain. The brain literally lights up with a good kiss,
and kissing activates 5 out of 12 cranial nerves. More important, though, for those 6 seconds
when you leave each other and when you return to each other, you are disconnecting from the world
outside and reconnecting with your partner and the world you are creating together.
In just 6 seconds you tell each other that you matter, and you choose each other all over again.</p><p>保持激情</p><p>保持关系中激情流动的一种简单方法是接吻。经常接吻。每次你们分开和再次见面时都要接吻。
我们不是说像对待祖母一样亲吻对方的唇，而是建议进行一次6秒钟的热情深吻，这会让你的祖母（或任何其他观看你们两个的人）脸红。
当你热情地接吻时，你会引发一系列激素和神经递质的化学反应，释放多巴胺并增加催产素，这两者都会让你感觉很好。
真的很好。如果你真心地接吻，你的血管会扩张，你的大脑会接收到额外的氧气，你的瞳孔会扩大，你的脸颊会泛红。
嘴唇是我们身体最敏感的性感区域，与大脑的相当大一部分有关。大脑在一次良好的接吻中会“点亮”，接吻会激活头部12条脑神经中的5条。
更重要的是，在你们彼此分开和再次相聚的那6秒钟里，你们正在与外界断开联系，重新与伴侣和你们一起创造的世界相连。
在短短的6秒钟里，你们彼此传达了“你很重要”，并再次选择了彼此。</p><p>As we mentioned above, the largest study of love on the planet, with 70,000 people in 24 countries,
found that in all great relationships, kissing passionately for no reason at all was one universal key to a great sex life.
Sheril Kirshenbaum, in her book The Science of Kissing, cites a ten-year German study that
found that men who kissed their wives before leaving for work lived five years longer and earned 20 percent more
than men who “left without a peck goodbye.”</p><p>正如我们上面提到的，全球最大的关于爱的研究，涉及24个国家的70,000人，发现在所有伟大的关系中，无缘无故热情地接吻是一个通往美好性生活的普遍关键。
Sheril Kirshenbaum在她的书《接吻的科学》中引用了一项为期十年的德国研究，发现亲吻妻子上班前的丈夫比“不亲吻离开”的丈夫多活五年，收入增加20%。</p><p>Another key way to keep passion flowing is to express your fondness and affection and appreciation of each other verbally.
You can’t just thinkpositive things about your partner, you need to verbalizethem to your partner.
Appreciate their efforts, their attractiveness, their intelligence, their work, their skills, their sense of humor,
and whatever else about them you love and admire.
The Love Lab found that successful relationships have a 20 to 1 ratio of positive to negative
in all their everyday interactions in the apartment lab.
This means for every one time you roll your eyes at something your partner says or does,
you need to counteract this with 20 positive responses and reactions.
When they want your attention, you give it to them. You ask how each other’s day went while making eye contact,
you talk about the things that are stressing them out, you listen to them, and you empathize with their struggles.
Every time you’re together there is an opportunity to learn more about each other and become closer.
When you are apart, send love texts, or flirt with each other over the phone or by email.
Let your partner know you are thinking about them and loving them.
These little acts and stolen moments of connection—the kind that happen outside the bedroom—are exactly
what will keep the passion in your relationship alive far more than any wild tricks you might try out behind closed doors.
Take time to date each other, to get to know each other day in and day out, and create your own rituals for connection.
Making love to each other is something you do with your minds and your hearts—whether the body is involved or not.
And trust us when we say, these types of loving gestures and romantic rituals will make your desire
for each other grow over the years.</p><p>保持激情流动的另一个关键方法是用言辞表达你们对彼此的喜爱、亲昵和欣赏。你不能只是想着对伴侣的正面评价，你需要把这些想法口头表达给伴侣。
欣赏他们的努力、吸引力、智慧、工作、技能、幽默感以及你所爱慕的其他方面。爱情实验室发现，在一对成功的夫妻关系中，
公寓实验室中他们日常互动中的正面反应与负面反应的比例是20比1。这意味着每当你对伴侣说或做某事时眼睛翻白，你需要以20次积极的回应和反应来抵消这种情况。
当他们想要你的关注时，你给予他们。你注视着对方，询问彼此的一天过得怎么样，你谈论让他们感到压力的事情，你倾听他们，并对他们的困境表示同情。
每当你们在一起时，都有机会更多地了解彼此，变得更亲密。当你们分开时，通过短信表达爱意，或通过电话或电子邮件与对方调情。
让伴侣知道你在思念他们、爱着他们。这些小小的行为和窃取的连接时刻——那些在卧室之外发生的时刻——正是能够让你们关系中的激情保持活力的关键，
远比你们在密闭房间里尝试的任何疯狂技巧更加有效。花时间约会对方，日复一日地了解对方，创造属于你们自己的连接仪式。
彼此之间的爱是你们以思想和心灵共同创造的——无论身体是否参与。相信我们的话，这些爱的表达和浪漫的仪式会让你们对彼此的渴望在多年后持续增长。
无缘无故热情地接吻是实现美好性生活的一把通用钥匙。</p><p>KISSING PASSIONATELY FOR NO REASON AT ALL IS ONE UNIVERSAL KEY TO A GREAT SEX LIFE.</p><p>The Date: SEX &amp; INTIMACY</p><p>CONVERSATION TOPIC</p><p>Exploring and discussing romance, sex, and physical intimacy.</p><p>PREPARATION</p><p>Reflect on what you read in this chapter and any ideas it sparked about what you want sex and passion
to look like in your relationship or marriage. What rituals for connection might you create?
If sex is hard for you to talk about, be prepared to say so and explore why it’s hard.
There is no right or wrong way to talk about sex. It starts with being brave enough to say whatever’s on your mind.</p><p>LOCATION</p><p>For this date you will have a candlelit dinner somewhere.
It could be in your favorite romantic restaurant or a public place where you can be very private—such
as a cove in a beach or a hidden corner of a public garden. The theme is intimacy, sex, and romance.
Is there a place that’s especially romantic and intimate for you and your partner?
You could also do something physical to get into your body before the date, such as a dance class, a yoga class,
or a session of stretching together.</p><p>SUGGESTIONS</p><p>We suggest that you make this date as romantic and seductive as possible.
If you’re going out, dress in a way that your partner finds sexy. If you don’t know what way this is—ask him or her.
You may even decide to let the other person pick your clothes for this “sex” date.
For this conversation, you’ll want to be in your body.
As you focus on discussing physical intimacy with your partner, tune into your physical experience as well.
Midway through the questions, stop and check in with your body and your partner. Is your heart beating quickly?
Is your breathing slow or fast? Are you turned on? Slowly scan from the tip of your toes up to the crown of your head,
checking in with each body part.</p><p>无缘无故热情地接吻是实现美好性生活的一个普遍关键。</p><p>约会：性与亲密</p><p>对话主题</p><p>探索和讨论浪漫、性和身体亲密关系。</p><p>准备工作</p><p>反思一下你在本章中读到的内容，以及它在你的关系或婚姻中对你对性和激情的期望引发的任何想法。你可以创造哪些用于建立联系的仪式？

你们还可以在约会前做一些身体活动，比如一堂舞蹈课、一堂瑜伽课或一次一起伸展的活动。</p><p>建议</p><p>我们建议你将这个约会安排得尽可能浪漫和诱人。如果你要外出，穿上让你的伴侣觉得性感的服装。如果你不知道他或她喜欢哪种方式，可以问一下。
你甚至可以决定让对方为这个“性”约会挑选你的服装。在这次对话中，你会希望身体感受到。当你专注于与伴侣讨论身体亲密时，也要留意你的身体体验。
在问题进行到一半时，停下来与自己和伴侣进行检查。你的心脏是否急速跳动？你的呼吸是缓慢还是快速？你是否被激发起来？
缓慢地从脚尖一直扫描到头顶，检查每个身体部位的感受。</p><p>AT-HOME DATE:</p><p>If you’re going to have this date at home, arrange to have the place to yourselves and have the date naked, in bed.

attitude instead of a “YES, BUT  .  .  .” attitude toward your partner’s ideas. Yes, and  .  .  . means
that you accept everything your partner says as true for them, and in the spirit of improvisation
(which is where Yes, and  .  .  . comes from) you add to the conversation and understanding between you.

They looked forward to going on the money date,
because money has been an issue between them since they first began dating.
Adam likes to plan for the future and for a rainy day,
and is almost fanatical about having a minimum of six-months’ worth of rent and bills socked away in case of emergency.
Trevor believes any extra money should be spent on fun and recreation and experiences that will last a lifetime.
“Life is short,” said Trevor. “You might not be here tomorrow, so why wait.
I don’t want a bucket list. I have a do-it-now list.”</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="第四次约会">第四次约会<a class="hash-link" href="#第四次约会" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>爱的代价</p><p>工作与金钱</p><p>亚当和特雷弗已经结婚两年多了，但他们已经同居了五年。
他们期待着进行金钱方面的约会，因为从他们开始约会以来，金钱一直是他们之间的一个问题。
亚当喜欢为未来和雨天做计划，他几乎痴迷于至少储备六个月的租金和账单的金钱以应对急情况。
特雷弗认为任何多余的钱应该花在有趣的事、娱乐活动和能持续一生的经历上。
“生命是短暂的，”特雷弗说。“明天你可能就不在了，所以为什么要等待呢。我不想要一个遗愿清单，我有一个现在就去做的清单。”</p><p>The conflicts over money seemed fairly easy to resolve in their first couple of years together.
They saved half of what Adam wanted to save every month,
and spent the other half on what Trevor wanted—exciting weekends away together and trying new things like paddleboarding
and zip-lining. But when Adam received a small inheritance,
their minor disagreement over money turned into a major fight. “It was extra money, above the budget,
so I wanted to put all of it right into savings,” said Adam. “But Trevor wanted to travel.
We’d always dreamed of going to Southeast Asia, but we didn’t have the money for that kind of a trip.
Especially because we are both freelancers, so it wasn’t only the cost of the trip,
but the cost of our missed hours at work.”</p><p>在他们在一起的最初几年里
，关于钱的冲突似乎相当容易解决。他们每个月存下了亚当想要存的一半钱，用另一半钱去满足特雷弗的愿望——一起度过令人兴奋的周末和尝试划桨板和滑索等新事物。
但是当亚当收到一笔小额继承时，他们关于钱的小分歧变成了一场大争吵。“这是额外的钱，超出了预算，所以我想把所有的钱都存起来，”亚当说。
“但特雷弗想去旅行。我们一直梦想去东南亚，但我们没有足够的钱来支付那样的旅行费用。
尤其是因为我们都是自由职业者，所以不仅是旅行费用的问题，还有我们错过的工作时间的代价。”</p><p>“It was a gift,” says Trevor. “It was a chance to do something we always dreamed of doing.
I couldn’t make him see my point of view. Plus it was his inheritance, so I felt like I could only argue to a point.”</p><p>“He was really upset,” says Adam. “It was big. As far as I was concerned it was our money—we share everything—but
I couldn’t really understand why he didn’t see it as a chance for us to get ahead for once
and have a bigger cushion if we needed it. I wanted to travel, too, but I couldn’t see taking all that time off work.
It felt risky to me.”</p><p>“这是一份礼物，”特雷弗说。“这是一个我们一直梦想实现的机会。我无法让他理解我的观点。而且这是他的继承，所以我感觉我只能争论到一定程度。”</p><p>“他非常生气，”亚当说。“这是一笔大款项。在我看来，那是我们的钱——我们分享一切——但我无法真正理解为什么他不把它看作是我们有机会取得进展、
如果需要的话有更大的保障的机会。我也想旅行，但我无法考虑到那么长的时间不工作。对我来说，那感觉很冒险。”</p><p>Everything changed when they started to explore what money actually meant to each other.
Trevor’s dad had died very young, at the age of 35. “My parents talked about taking us on lots of travel adventures,
but the trips were always off in some magical future. Somedaywe would go to Disneyland. Someday we would go to Hawaii.
And when my dad died, all those magical adventures died with him. Someday never happened.
When you’re on your deathbed, you’re never going to regret the memories you’ve created
with the people you love—you’re only going to regret what you didn’t do.”</p><p>一切都改变了，当他们开始探索金钱对彼此的实际意义时。特雷弗的父亲在很年轻的时候去世，只有35岁。
“我的父母曾经谈论过带我们去很多旅行冒险，但这些旅行总是被安排在某个神奇的未来。总有一天，我们会去迪斯尼乐园。
总有一天，我们会去夏威夷。当我爸爸去世时，所有那些神奇的冒险也随之而逝。总有一天从未到来。
当你躺在临终的床上时，你不会后悔与你爱的人创造的回忆，你只会后悔你没有做过的事情。”</p><p>Adam’s parents never saved. “My dad lost his job and we were in bad shape.
He had nothing to fall back on—no savings whatsoever.
We got by, but not being able to provide for his family crushed him.
My sister and I both started working really young, at twelve and fourteen,
doing whatever we could for money just to help pay the rent and get food.
It was hard. He ended up getting a great job and doing really well,
but I was really resentful of him early on because they had nothing saved to tide us through.
Now he always asks me if I’m saving, and what my backup plan is if I lose my job.
He really put that fear in me. This inheritance from my grandmother really means a lot,
and I want to put it to good use.”</p><p>亚当的父母从来没有存钱。“我爸爸失去了工作，我们的状况很糟糕。他没有任何可以依靠的东西，没有任何储蓄。我们勉强过日子，
但是无法为家庭提供支持让他备受打击。我和姐姐都很早就开始工作，十二岁和十四岁的时候，尽力挣钱来帮助支付房租和买食物。
那是很困难的时期。后来他找到了一份好工作，事业也很成功，但是我一开始对他怀有很多怨恨，因为他们没有任何储蓄可以帮助我们渡过难关。
现在他总是问我是否在存钱，如果我失业了，我有没有备用计划。他给我灌输了那种恐惧。这笔来自我的祖母的遗产对我来说意义重大，我想好好利用它。”</p><p>Once Adam and Trevor understood what money actually represented for each of them,
and understood their very different family histories with spending and saving, the conflict over the inheritance ended.
Even though Adam offered to go on the trip to Southeast Asia,
Trevor suggested they put only 10 percent toward the trip and try to find ways to travel on a budget.
“Once I heard about his dad losing his job, I understood where he was coming from. It wasn’t about me.
It was about how he grew up, and I wouldn’t have felt right if we had spent all the money on a big trip.
A little of it is okay with me. I think we’re going to have a better balance with the money issue going forward.”</p><p>一旦亚当和特雷弗理解了金钱对他们各自的意义，并了解了他们在支出和储蓄方面非常不同的家庭历史，关于遗产的冲突就结束了。
尽管亚当提出要去东南亚旅行，特雷弗建议他们只拿出10%的钱用于旅行，并尝试以预算的方式旅行。“一旦我听说他父亲失业的事情，我就理解他的立场了。
这不是关于我，而是关于他的成长经历，如果我们把所有的钱都花在一次大旅行上，我会觉得不对劲。用一点点钱旅行我可以接受。
我认为在金钱问题上，我们未来会有更好的平衡。”</p><p>Whether your bank account is robust or you’re living paycheck to paycheck,
money is one of the top five reasons couples fight.
Research on a sample of 4,574 couples shows that, of all the issues married couples fight about,
financial arguments were the single best predictor of divorce.
The other four issues that couples get into conflict over the most? Sex, in-laws, alcohol or drug use, and parenting.</p><p>无论你的银行账户是丰满的还是你靠着发薪日勉强度日，金钱是夫妻争吵的五个最主要原因之一。

另外还有另外四个夫妻经常因之发生冲突的问题是性、姻亲、酒精或药物使用，以及育儿。</p><p>Unless you have an unlimited trust fund, work can’t be separated from the conversation about money.
Many of the couples who went on these eight dates worked long hours at their jobs or spent long hours at school.
Time and money and work were issues that permeated many of the conversations—especially the dates around commitment,
family, play and fun, and dreams.</p><p>除非你有无限的信托基金，否则工作无法与金钱的谈话分开。许多参与这八个约会的夫妻在工作中长时间工作或在学校度过很长时间。
时间、金钱和工作是许多对话中的主题，尤其是关于承诺、家庭、娱乐和梦想的约会。</p><p>For most couples, the arguments around money tend to fall into three distinct categories: different perceptions
of financial inequality, different perceptions of what it means to have financial well-being,
and different perceptions about the nature of how they argue about money.
Of all the three, the nature of the arguments was the best predictor of whether a couple would break up.
What this means is that conflicts over finances don’t need to be a “make or break” issue.
What matters most is how a couple talks about their financial disagreements.</p><p>对于大多数夫妻来说，围绕金钱的争论通常可以归类为三个不同的类别：对财务不平等的不同看法、对财务幸福的不同看法以及对金钱争论方式的不同看法。
在这三个方面中，争论的方式是预测夫妻是否分手的最佳指标。这意味着财务冲突不必成为一个&quot;成败关键&quot;的问题。最重要的是夫妻如何谈论他们在财务上的分歧。</p><p>Couples need to avoid the dichotomy of characterizing one another in terms of the two most common stereotypes:
the Spender and the Saver.</p><p>The Spender sees himself or herself as wisely using money to live a happy life, one with comfort, well-being,
generosity, health, and fun for the entire family. In stereotyping the Spender, the Saver uses terms like frivolous,
thoughtless, impulsive, lavish, wasteful, extravagant, or self-indulgent.</p><p>The Saver sees himself or herself as practical, conservative, wise, and stoic.
The Saver values money as accomplishment, security, success, power, freedom from worry, an investment in the future,
and a future legacy. In stereotyping the Saver, the Spender uses terms like miserly, cold, mean, stingy, selfish,
cheap, cynical, and a hoarder who doesn’t know how to enjoy pleasure.</p><p>夫妻需要避免将对方划分为两种最常见的刻板印象：花钱者和储蓄者。</p><p>花钱者视自己为明智地运用金钱过上幸福的生活，为整个家庭提供舒适、幸福、慷慨、健康和乐趣。
在将花钱者刻板化的过程中，储蓄者使用诸如轻浮、不考虑后果、冲动、奢华、浪费、奢侈或纵欲等词语。</p><p>储蓄者视自己为实际、保守、明智和坚忍不拔。储蓄者将金钱视为成就、安全、成功、权力、无忧无虑、未来投资和未来的遗产。
在将储蓄者刻板化的过程中，花钱者使用吝啬、冷漠、刻薄、吝啬、自私、小气、愤世嫉俗以及贪婪且不知享受乐趣等词语。</p><p>The truth is we’re all savers and spenders at different times, and stereotypes rarely help us come to any understanding
about what money means to our partner that helps us in navigating money conflicts as they arise.
Whether or not you’re married, the conflict money creates isn’t about numbers—it’s about what money means.
Money buys pleasure, and it also buys security. Balancing the two can be work for any couple,
and ultimately the goal is to balance the freedom and empowerment money represents with the security
and trust it also signifies.</p><p>Each partner comes to the relationship with their own history and relationship with money
and their own set of feelings connected to money.
We all have a legacy about money—a story that is handed down from generation to generation
about what money has meant to our family.</p><p>事实上，我们在不同的时候都是储蓄者和花钱者，而刻板印象很少能帮助我们理解对方对金钱的意义，从而在处理金钱冲突时给予帮助。
无论你是否结婚，金钱引起的冲突不仅仅是关于数字，更关乎金钱的意义。金钱可以购买快乐，也可以带来安全感。
在任何夫妻关系中，平衡这两者都可能是一项工作，最终的目标是平衡金钱所代表的自由和权力与它所象征的安全和信任。</p><p>每个伴侣都带着自己对金钱的历史和关系，以及与金钱相关的一系列感受来到关系中。
我们都有一个关于金钱的遗产，一种代代相传的故事，关于金钱在我们家族中的意义。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="working-hard-for-the-money">WORKING HARD FOR THE MONEY<a class="hash-link" href="#working-hard-for-the-money" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Work can take up nearly as much of our time, energy, and ability to commit as our relationship.
In fact, work can often be the “third party” in a relationship.
Having a conversation about your commitment to work and making money is just as important
as your discussion about what commitment means in your relationship or marriage.
Our relationship demands our time, and our work demands our time.
It is a myth that to have a good marriage you have to choose one or the other. You don’t.
The problem comes when our commitment to work and to our partner are in conflict,
so how we find a way to satisfy both commitments is fundamental to the success of our relationship.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="为金钱而辛勤工作">为金钱而辛勤工作<a class="hash-link" href="#为金钱而辛勤工作" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>工作几乎占据了我们的时间、精力和承诺能力，与我们的关系一样多。事实上，工作常常成为关系中的“第三方”。
就像你讨论关系或婚姻中的承诺意味着什么一样，讨论你对工作和赚钱的承诺同样重要。
我们的关系需要我们的时间，而工作也需要我们的时间。认为要有一段美满的婚姻，你必须在两者之间选择其中之一，这是一个错误的观念。
问题出现在我们对工作和伴侣的承诺发生冲突时，所以如何找到同时满足两者承诺的方式对于我们关系的成功至关重要。</p><p>Obviously if one or both of you is working 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week
this won’t leave much time or energy to spend on the relationship. It’s a simple numbers game.
And as the saying goes, no one, on their deathbed, says “I wish I spent more time at the office.”
If one of you is working incredibly long hours, is overly stressed and pressured by career demands,
or is willing to sacrifice the relationship in the name of ambition or pursuit of money,
this isn’t sustainable or conducive to a happy marriage. Long hours at work can pull people apart,
leave little time for connection, and create loneliness in the relationship.</p><p>John and Julie go on a honeymoon every year. It is a ritual they have created to celebrate
and honor their union—a way to show that their relationship is still important enough to merit time away from careers,
family, friends, and obligations as it was when they first got married. It’s not always easy.
They have busy clinical practices, demanding research, and some years, books to write and deadlines to meet.
At age 71, John decided to pursue a work dream—writing a book for therapists summarizing his 15 years of
using mathematical equations and the laws of physics to understand love.
It was an ambitious project, to say the least, and John loved every second of it.</p><p>很明显，如果你们中的一方或两方每周工作60、80甚至100个小时，就不会有太多时间和精力用于关系。这是一个简单的数字游戏。就像那句话说的，没有人在临终时会说“我希望我在办公室花更多的时间”。如果其中一方工作时间非常长，被职业要求过度压力和压迫，或者愿意为了追求抱负或金钱而牺牲关系，这是不可持续的，也不利于幸福的婚姻。长时间的工作会拉扯人们之间的距离，留下很少的时间用于沟通，给关系带来孤独感。</p><p>Growing up in a one-bedroom apartment with five people, John developed an amazing ability to focus
and block out everything around him while he worked. When he’s working with such intensity,
you could be in the same room as him, calling out his name, and he wouldn’t hear you.
It’s a skill that helped him survive in a crowded home growing up, helped him obtain his PhD,
and allowed him to spend hours intensely studying the micromannerisms and expressions of couples in the Love Lab.
For this particular book, John was driven and on a mission.
And this mission was overriding everything else in his life—including Julie.</p><p>约翰和朱莉每年都会度蜜月。这是他们创造的一种仪式，用来庆祝和尊重他们的婚姻，表明他们的关系仍然重要到足以值得脱离工作、家庭、朋友和义务的时间。
这并不总是容易的。他们有繁忙的临床工作，要求严苛的研究，有些年份还要写书并满足截稿时间。
71岁时，约翰决定追求一个工作梦想——写一本为治疗师总结他15年来使用数学方程和物理定律来理解爱情的书籍。
可以说，这是一个雄心勃勃的项目，约翰喜欢其中的每一秒钟。</p><p>Preparing to leave on their fourteenth annual honeymoon, John packed his mathematical equations and his physics books,
including stacks of research papers, graphs, and complicated formulas. All of which went into the suitcase.
He was obsessed. He was focused. This was his work, and it was a priority for him.
He had already been intensely working on this book for the last year</p><p>在准备开始他们第14次年度蜜月旅行时，约翰打包了他的数学方程和物理书籍，包括一堆研究论文、图表和复杂的公式，全部都放进了行李箱里。
他沉迷其中，专注于他的工作，这对他来说是优先事项。他已经在过去一年中非常专注地致力于这本书。</p><p>On their first five days away, John worked on the book 16 hours a day.
He was in mathematical heaven. On their fifth night, they pulled up to their favorite Italian restaurant,
with soft lighting and a piano player crooning away in the corner.
John read over the menu and then asked Julie what she wanted to eat.
She meant to say, “fettuccini Alfredo” but instead burst into tears. John was stupefied. Why was she crying?
And that’s when Julie poured out all her misery about this last year, including the last five days.
The honeymoon was supposed to be their special time to reconnect and celebrate their love,
and John had ignored her the entire time. His drive to turn his research into a book had taken over everything,
including their honeymoon.</p><p>在度假的头五天里，约翰每天工作16个小时在书上。他陶醉在数学的天堂里。第五天晚上，他们来到他们最喜欢的意大利餐厅，灯光柔和，钢琴手在角落里轻声演奏。
约翰看了一下菜单，然后问朱莉想要吃什么。她本想说“意大利奶油面”，但却突然哭了起来。约翰惊呆了。她为什么哭呢？
这时朱莉倾诉了她过去一年的痛苦，包括过去五天的经历。蜜月旅行本应是他们重新连接和庆祝爱情的特殊时刻，但约翰却完全忽视了她。
他对将自己的研究转化为一本书的追求已经占据了一切，包括他们的蜜月。</p><p>Julie’s tears shook John out of his intense and one-pointed focus. Yes, he loved his work,
and wanted to further his career with this book for other therapists, but he realized at that moment,
he had to balance it with his love for Julie.</p><p>朱莉的眼泪打破了约翰那种强烈而专注的状态。是的，他热爱他的工作，并希望通过这本书进一步发展自己的职业，为其他治疗师服务，但他意识到在那一刻，
他必须平衡对工作的热爱和对朱莉的爱。</p><p>John working 16 hours a day on his book during their annual honeymoon was in conflict with the commitment he
and Julie had made to spend this time connecting to one another. Even though he was a marriage expert,
it took Julie’s tears for John to realize just how far out of balance his priorities had gotten.
His book was a work dream of his, but in that moment he had to acknowledge that his long hours of research and writing,
while beneficial to him, weren’t beneficial to his relationship.</p><p>约翰在他们每年一度的蜜月期间每天工作16个小时的行为与他和朱莉所做的相互连接的承诺相冲突。
即使他是一位婚姻专家，但正是朱莉的眼泪让约翰意识到他的优先事项已经失衡得有多严重。
他的书是他的梦想，但在那一刻，他必须承认，他漫长的研究和写作时间虽然对他有益，但对他的关系却没有好处。</p><p>At that particular time.</p><p>Julie wasn’t asking him to give up something that was meaningful to him forever,
she wasn’t telling him to choose between the book and her;
she was just asking that he give it up for their honeymoon week.</p><p>就在那个特定的时刻。</p><p>朱莉并不是要约翰永远放弃对他有意义的事情，她也不是要他在书和她之间做选择；
她只是希望他在他们的蜜月周放弃工作。</p><p>If you or your partner is starting a business, for example, it’ll take time and commitment and long hours,
but as long as you  are transparent about the commitment you’re making to your work and financial future,
and you discuss it and make agreements with your partner ahead of time, it doesn’t have to be a deal breaker.
And the long hours are not going to last forever. Obviously, unless we are independently wealthy,
we all need to work to survive. Bills have to be paid. Food, clothing, and shelter are necessities.
Yes, work means money, but it can also mean personal fulfillment, accomplishment, and even purpose, meaning,
and passion in life. These things also matter.</p><p>如果你或你的伴侣正在创业，例如，这将需要时间、承诺和长时间的工作，
但只要你对你的工作和经济未来所作的承诺坦诚相待，
并提前与伴侣进行讨论和达成协议，它不会成为一个破坏关系的问题。
而且长时间的工作并不会持续太久。显然，除非我们是独立富裕的，
否则我们都需要工作来维持生计。账单必须支付。食物、衣物和住所是必需品。
是的，工作意味着金钱，但它也可以意味着个人成就感、完成感，甚至是生活中的目标、意义和激情。这些事情也很重要。</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharing-the-load">SHARING THE LOAD<a class="hash-link" href="#sharing-the-load" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>In the 1950s, this conversation about work and money was uncommon.
The man was the breadwinner who donned his coat and hat and left the house for the office every morning.
Careers were kept for a lifetime—the same job from hire to retire. He made the money. He had the power.
In a marriage, the woman stayed at home and took care of the house, the children, the cooking, and the cleaning.
The media strongly suggested that women greet their husbands at the door at the end of the day, looking lovely,
with a cocktail in her hand for her hardworking man.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="分担负担">分担负担<a class="hash-link" href="#分担负担" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>在上世纪50年代，关于工作和金钱的这种对话并不常见。
男性是主要的经济来源，每天早上穿上外套和帽子离开家去办公室。
职业生涯常常维持一辈子，从入职到退休都在同一份工作中。他挣钱，他有权力。
在婚姻中，女性待在家里负责照顾家务、孩子、烹饪和清洁。
媒体强烈建议妻子在丈夫一天结束时迎接他，容光焕发，手里拿着一杯鸡尾酒，以示对他辛勤工作的奖励。</p><p>It’s not 1950.</p><p>Everything has changed, and these traditional roles have been in flux for decades.
Women work and parent, and men work and parent. Fathers now more commonly stay home with the children,
and sometimes mothers still do as well. Even more commonly, both spouses work. Household chores, ideally, are shared.
Nurturing is shared. Money and power are shared.</p><p>确实，现在已不是1950年了。</p><p>一切都发生了变化，这些传统角色已经多年来处于不断变化之中。
现在，女性既工作又育儿，男性也既工作又育儿。现在越来越多的父亲选择与孩子待在家里，有时母亲也会这样做。更常见的情况是，夫妻双方都在工作。理想情况下，家务事应该由双方共同承担。关爱孩子的责任也是共同承担的。金钱和权力也是共享的。</p><p>Even people’s fond memories of the 1950s are flawed, as Stephanie Coontz pointed out in her book The Way We Never Were.
Back then, married women were often depressed and anxious,
feeling unfulfilled without feeling entitled to their own dreams, without financial freedom,
dominated by their husbands, and taking medications to control their sadness and anger.
Women and men who were unmarried, gay or lesbian,
or in alternative relationships were often left out of the cultural story altogether.</p><p>正如斯蒂芬妮·库恩茨在她的书《我们从未存在的方式》中指出的那样，即使人们怀有对20世纪50年代美好的回忆，这些回忆也存在缺陷。
当时，已婚妇女经常感到沮丧和焦虑，感到没有实现自己的梦想的权利，没有经济自由，受丈夫的控制，并服用药物来控制自己的悲伤和愤怒。
单身、同性恋者或处于其他关系中的女性和男性往往被完全忽视于当时的文化故事之外。</p><p>Today, women ages 25 to 32 begin their careers more educated than their male counterparts.
Thirty-eight percent of women joining the workforce have at least a four-year college degree compared to 31 percent
of men in the same age group. In fact, in 2015 in the United States, women made up more than half (51 percent) of
the technical and professional workforce. And according to Pew Research,
the percentage of women who consider having a high-paying career “one of the most important things
in their lives” is greater than the percentage of men in the same age group.
Sixty-six percent of women rate a career as high on their list of priorities, compared to 59 percent of men.
The same research study also reveals that both men and women rate having a successful marriage as more important
than a successful career. Love, it seems, trumps work no matter what decade we’re living in.
The good news is that people don’t have to choose between work and a relationship.
In fact, research shows that if you’re happy in your marriage you’re more likely to be happier in your job.
The reverse is also true, job satisfaction can predict marital satisfaction,
but researchers found this link to be weaker.</p><p>如今，年龄在25至32岁之间的女性在职业生涯开始时比男性同龄人更受教育。
加入职场的女性中，有38%拥有至少四年制大学学位，而在同一年龄段的男性中，这一比例为31%。
实际上，根据2015年的美国数据，女性在技术和专业领域的从业人员中占了半数以上（51%）。
根据皮尤研究中心的调查，认为拥有高薪职业是“生活中最重要的事情之一”的女性比同龄男性的比例更高。
66%的女性将职业列为他们的优先事项，而男性中这一比例为59%。
同一项研究还发现，无论生活在哪个时代，无论男性还是女性，他们都认为拥有成功的婚姻比成功的职业更为重要。看起来，无论是哪个年代，爱情都胜过工作。
好消息是，人们不必在工作和感情之间选择。实际上，研究表明，如果你在婚姻中感到幸福，你在工作中也更有可能更加幸福。
反之亦然，工作满意度可以预测婚姻满意度，但研究发现这种联系较弱。</p><p>There is one type of work that reliably causes conflict for couples—unpaid work.
Couples fight more about the division of labor in the household—dishes, cleaning,
laundry—than they do about outside or paid jobs.
In fact, another Pew Research study in 2007 showed that after faithfulness and a good sex life,
sharing household chores was listed as the most important element of a successful marriage.
Adequate income, good housing, shared religious beliefs, shared interests,
and children all came below sharing household chores.</p><p>有一种工作类型在夫妻关系中经常引起冲突，那就是无偿的家务劳动。
夫妻之间更多地为家庭事务的分工而争吵，比如洗碗、清洁和洗衣，而不是关于外部或有偿工作的问题。
事实上，皮尤研究中心在2007年进行的另一项调查显示，在忠诚和良好的性生活之后，分享家务被列为婚姻成功的最重要要素。
充足的收入、良好的住房、共同的宗教信仰、共同的兴趣以及孩子在分享家务之下。</p><p>If you hired someone to do the work of maintaining a household, especially if you have children,
the cost would be approximately $90,000 a year.
This is what a “traditional” at-home spouse would get paid today to clean the house,
be a personal shopper and personal assistant, run errands, and take care of the children.
It’s a lot of money, and it’s a lot of work.
Either you pay someone to do this or someone in the relationship has to take on these jobs.
According to Time Use data from 1965 through 2011, the amount of time men and women spend on paid work, unpaid work,
and child care (where applicable) are roughly equal; 59 hours a week for men on average, 58 hours a week for women.
In 1965, men spent an average of 6.5 hours a week on unpaid work such as housework and child care.
In 2011, men spent an average of 17 hours a week on unpaid work.
In contrast, women used to spend an average of 32 hours a week on housework alone,
and that number (thanks to the men sharing the load) had fallen to 18 hours a week in 2011.
The roles of men and women in relation to work are converging, and in the twenty-first century
there is no right or wrong way to divide the labor—it’s whatever works for the two of you.
In the era of the collaborative marriage, where you’re part of a team, you’ll need to decide together
what works for your relationship and your life. And know that this will change once you have children,
and it’ll change as you switch careers, and as you work together to support each other’s dreams.
Work is about so much more than a paycheck, and your views about what work and money mean will evolve over a lifetime.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-is-money">TIME IS MONEY<a class="hash-link" href="#time-is-money" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Work and the pursuit of money will mean different things at different times in your life,
and finding the right balance can be difficult. There will be both costs and benefits to the relationship,
depending on the work choices each of you makes.
If you enter into a long-term relationship or marriage thinking that you and your partner
will always leave work at 5 p.m. every day, ready to go out, or cook dinner, or hit the gym,
or take a class together, or have a deep discussion—you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.
Sometimes work demands will feel like there’s been a hostile takeover of your free time and your relationship,
and you need to make sure your relationship is solid enough to handle these times.</p><p>While Rachel was in her medical residency, she and Doug had very little time together.
The hours were long and brutal, she was sleep-deprived,
and it seemed as if they never saw each other except for their weekly date night.
Doug supported Rachel’s work dream of becoming a physician,
but not being able to connect and spend time together had driven a wedge between them.
They were both feeling dissatisfied and started arguing more during the brief time they saw each other.
While they kept up with scheduling a date night, during it they both felt frustrated and alone.
“I remember one date night in particular, because we never made it out of the parking lot of
the apartment complex we were living in,” remembered Rachel. “We just sat in the car, side by side,
and I just felt exhausted, numb, and kind of lost. I was working so hard, for us,
but somehow in the middle of my grueling residency, we had lost that us.
All that was left was work, and I turned to Doug and said, ‘I’m afraid we’re not going to make it.’
I think we were both equally shocked when I said the words out loud.”</p><p>It was this moment of vulnerability and honesty that allowed both of them to drop their frustration.
They sat in the car and wept at the idea of not having each other and losing everything they had together.
That possibility was devastating, and in the middle of the parking lot, Rachel had an epiphany.</p><p>“I realized my marriage was the most important thing to me, and if it came down to making a choice,
I would give up medicine, and do something else for work.”</p><p>For Rachel, her priorities became clear in the midst of crisis. Instead of giving up medicine,
she ended up telling her residency supervisor that she needed a month off because being on call 24/7 was causing
her marriage to fall apart. During that month, she and Doug made a list of what their priorities would be
in their life and in their marriage. First on their list came their health and spiritual well-being.
Next came their marriage. Then family, and then work and money. These were important,
but Rachel and Doug realized that for them, these priorities were last on their list.
Every couple should come to an agreement about priorities, but each couple will be unique.
You and your partner should talk about your own priorities and what you value.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="managing-time">MANAGING TIME<a class="hash-link" href="#managing-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The complaint that one partner works too much is a common one.
Great marriages require that each person gives their time and energy to the other partner.
Whether you’re the spouse who’s overworking or the spouse who’s complaining about the overwork,
it helps to have a conversation that explores both points of view. Often our identity, our purpose,
and our self-worth can get tied into “what we do” and this compels us to work long hours.
But consistent long hours come at a price, and like Doug and Rachel,
you both may start to feel emotionally disconnected and this puts your relationship at risk.
If your time together is compromised because of one or the other’s work schedule, ask each other the following questions:</p><p>For the partner working long hours:</p><p>What does your work mean to you?</p><p>What pleasure or satisfaction does work bring to you?</p><p>What need does working fulfill in your life?</p><p>How would you spend your day if money was no object and you didn’t have to work?</p><p>For the partner who is frustrated by the long hours:</p><p>What does your partner’s absence mean to you?</p><p>What do you miss about your partner when he or she is gone so much?</p><p>What are you longing for in terms of emotional, physical, intellectual, or spiritual connection with your partner?</p><p>Whenever long work hours become an issue in your relationship, the guided questions above will help
you come to understanding rather than conflict. How we choose to spend our time affects our relationship.
Spend some time reflecting on your average 24-hour day. Make a pie chart and map out your hours for a typical day.
How much time is spent working apart from each other (paid work outside the home),
and how many hours are spent working together (unpaid work in the home)?
How many hours are spent connecting in the relationship? How many with family (if applicable)?
How much time is spent alone? Now make a second pie chart and write down your ideal timefor each of these areas.
If, for example, you’d like to spend three hours a day connecting, and two hours a day solo,
and the reality is you spend about one hour for both—then you know what areas you need to work
on and what your priorities are. If you set your priorities for your time together at the beginning of your relationship,
this shared value of your time can be a guidepost. You have a goal you’ve created together,
and a metric to see when the balance has shifted in ways that aren’t in alignment with
what you’ve both decided is important to your relationship.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-real-value-of-money">THE REAL VALUE OF MONEY<a class="hash-link" href="#the-real-value-of-money" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Our own personal history with money can affect our relationships in surprising ways.
It’s important to explore what your family legacy is about money, generosity, power, and wealth.
What emotional history and thoughts do you have about being poor, about being dependent and independent,
about being strong and being weak, about philanthropy, civic responsibility, luxury, and pride of accomplishment?
When two people with two separate histories with money get together, they must face the challenge of merging
those two histories—or deal with the consequences of not addressing them.</p><p>The first step is to understand your own history.</p><p>The second step is to understand your partner’s history.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-much-is-enough">HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-much-is-enough" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>A Jewish scripture called the Talmud says a rich person is one who has enough. But “enough money” is a relative term.
Whether you’re scrimping to get by, or you have so much money you can’t spend it fast enough,
money can be a significant source of conflict for couples. So what is enough money?
Obviously couples have money problems when they live beyond their means,
go into the relationship with one partner having significant debt, keep financial secrets from each other,
or aren’t working as a team in meeting their financial goals. Everyone has short-term goals—make the rent or mortgage,
pay the household bills. Many couples also have long-term goals.
Budgeting together is a great way to come up with a plan to meet both your day-to-day and longer-term
financial obligations and desires. Each of you is one half of a financial team,
but each of you can also have very different views, as did Trevor and Adam, about how much money is enough.
This is because money has different symbolic meanings.</p><p>In our research with heterosexual couples, we’ve found that there can be profound differences between men
and women when it comes to money. Women don’t typically save money, and more than 58 percent of women born
between 1946 and 1964 (baby boomers) have saved less than $10,000 in retirement accounts.
It’s estimated that between one-third and two-thirds of women now aged 25 to 55 will be impoverished
when they are 70 years old. This is an astonishing statistic. And for many women,
having “enough” money can mean many different things. Women often equate “enough” money with love, respect, and security.
“Enough” money is also equated with acceptability, attractiveness, and strength.</p><p>Typically for men, there is interplay between money and power.
(This can also be true for women, but is more common in men, according to our research.)
When asked, men equate money with being competent, responsible, and a provider.
“Enough” money is often equated with strength, independence, maturity, competition, social power, and winning.
The bottom line is that money has meaning, beyond the expenses and the budgets and
the arithmetic involved with saving and spending.
The goal is to find out what money means to you, and understand what money means to your partner.</p><p>Exercise</p><p>MY FAMILY HISTORY WITH MONEY</p><p>Complete the questionnaire below, separately and before your date.

With this quiz, you can delve deep into understanding what money means to your partner.
Think about how you each contribute to the greater wealth of your relationship, whether that is time,
work around the house, or financially. It’s never too early to understand your
partner’s relationship and history with money, and it’s never too late either. For a lifetime of love,
and less conflict, express gratitude for what you have, what you each contribute, and what you are building together.
Different meanings drive different relationships to money. There are ways to make your money attitudes compatible.

Everyone knows family is the most important thing—but whether that’s just you and your partner,
or your friends are like family, or you have kids—it’s hard to say. I want a child,” said Jamal,
“but only one. The world’s overpopulated as it is,
and I don’t know what my ideal family is other than to be the opposite of the one I grew up in.”</p><p>Jamal and Luciana are engaged and planning to marry in the next year. They both grew up in large families,
and want to have children, but they disagree on how many children they want to have. “One is too lonely,”
countered Luciana, “and two is just so cookie-cutter normal.
I think three is perfect, it’s a big family without being too big.”</p><p>Jamal has strong feelings about having only one child. “In my family, there was never enough attention to go around.
With five kids, my parents were always in crisis mode. They loved us,
but I think with so many children their parenting was always about logistics and basic survival.
We spent time together—mostly because there was never enough money for any of us to do anything
outside the house—but it wasn’t what I would call quality time. Both my parents worked,
and I think my mom worked even longer hours than my dad. They were always exhausted.
I seriously don’t know why they had so many children.”</p><p>Luciana grew up with three siblings, and her mom didn’t work outside the home. “She was pretty traditional in that way.
Almost overly involved in our school and social lives, but she loved being a mom. We always had dinner together,
and we had this big master calendar in the kitchen where she tracked all our activities and sports schedules.
I swear she could have been a CEO—she was that good at managing people. She never seemed stressed out,
or like she was missing out on something in her own life. Even now that we’re all out of the house,
she volunteers all the time and teaches at the YMCA. She just loves kids.
I think she would have had ten children if my dad had been up for it. But they always emphasized our independence.
From the time we could walk they were preparing us to be on our own.
I had friends in college who didn’t even know how to do laundry, or cook an egg. It was crazy.
I want to pursue my career, but I think it’s possible to give your kids lots of time and attention and also do work you love.
You just need one of those giant wall calendars.”</p><p>For Jamal and Luciana, agreeing that they both want children is the make-or-break issue.
“I couldn’t be with someone who didn’t want any children,” said Luciana, “but I’m okay with disagreeing on the number.
Neither of us has any idea what the demands will really be on our lives—we know life will change dramatically and
be crazy in ways we can’t even predict—so while I think three is my ideal now,
I may very well change my mind when the reality sets in.”</p><p>They both agree, however, on the qualities and values they’d like to instill in their future children.
“I want our child to be a hard worker,” said Jamal. “I want him or her to be kind and selfless and not greedy or spoiled.”</p><p>Luciana wants them to have big education goals. “Master’s degrees and even beyond.
I want to raise them so that they value education and learning.”</p><p>Jamal looked dubious. “That’s going to be a lot of money if we have three.
Unless we can make two of them not value education.
Can you do that as parents? All that education is another reason to have one child!”</p><p>Luciana laughed. “I want them to have your sense of humor. And be outgoing like you are.
You have really good social skills. I want them to be comfortable around different groups of people.
I’m really shy and kind of introverted. You are really good at including everyone, and I want them to be like that.”</p><p>Jamal wants them to have Luciana’s can-do attitude. “She never gives up.
She’s so persistent about going after what she wants. I want that for our child, or children,
since she probably won’t give up on us having three.”</p><p>Jamal and Luciana’s ability to compromise and use humor as they discuss how many children
they might have is a good indicator that this is not likely to be a big source of conflict for them.
They are open and flexible and truly understand each other’s perspective.
We want you to approach the topic of family with the same humor and flexibility.
Family means different things to different people.
And the singular definition of family as a like-minded husband and wife,
with two children and a white picket fence is as outdated as pagers, VCRs, and calling the operator for information.
Today’s family is ethnically, politically, sexually, and religiously diverse.
Families can consist of biological children, stepchildren, adopted children, foster children, no children,
or your husband’s best friend who still acts like a child. There are also more families with same-sex or trans parents.
Family may just be you and your partner, or it could include your extended family, your pet, and your close friends.
Family can be defined as wherever and with whomever you feel love, belonging, and a sense of home.</p><p>However you define family now or in the future is up to you and your partner.
What’s most important is that you talk about what family means and what you both want your family to
look like and be like. And if children are part of the life plan,
it’s best to enter that future with some understanding and discussion of
how the love you share with each other—your primary relationship—is going to expand
and include the love you share with others. Discussing this now will save you a lot of heartache later on.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, if one of you wants children and one doesn’t, this can be a deal breaker for a relationship.
If you get married thinking that you can get your partner to change their mind on this issue somewhere down the line,
you’re setting yourself up for disaster. Discussing whether you want children is important,
as is discussing how many children you each imagine in your ideal family scenario.
If one of you thinks a family consists of one child,
and the other is imagining triple bunkbeds in each room to fit your baseball-team-sized roster of offspring,
that’s going to be a problem if you never confront it</p><p>We have been blessed with children, and they’re the loves of our lives. They’re also a lot of work. And a lot of money.
Statistics show that for a child born in the United States in 2015, it costs an average of $233,610
to raise that child through age 17. This is if you’re a middle-income family, averaging approximately $60,000 to
$100,000 a year in income. If together you make over $105,000,
then your average cost to raise a child to age 17 is an astonishing $407,820.
Now multiply this amount by the number of children you want to have.
And this is without any of the costs of college being factored in.
Some countries are better about providing their young people with a college education without causing the child or their family to go into debt, but in the United States, the cost of a private-school university degree, including tuition, housing, food, and books, can be as much as $80,000 a year. That is $320,000 in after-tax dollars per child.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stay-ahead-of-the-curve">STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE<a class="hash-link" href="#stay-ahead-of-the-curve" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>When we, the authors, think about having children, we think about sacrifice and about love.
When you welcome a child into your relationship you experience selflessness and a love that is profound.
There aren’t adequate words to describe falling in love with your child.
Falling in love with your partner is one thing, but the kind of falling in love that happens the first time
you hold your newborn baby is like being hit with a meteor. There’s no doubt that children need, demand,
and deserve your love, time, and attention, but this shouldn’t be at the expense of your primary relationship with each other.</p><p>Celebrity couple Giuliana and Bill Rancic said in an interview with US Weekly magazine,
“We put our marriage first and our child second.” This sound bite was big news and provoked debate
in the media about whether the two were “good” parents. What didn’t make the headlines
was the rest of the content around the headline:</p><p>We’re husband and wife but we’re also best friends. It’s funny because a lot of people, when they have kids,
they put the baby first and the marriage second. That works for some people.
For us, I find, we put our marriage first and our child second,
because the best thing we can do for him is have a strong marriage.</p><p>This debate about who should come first when partners have children is not unique to the Rancics.
Ayelet Waldman has faced public ire since her essay “Truly, Madly, Guiltily”
appeared in the New York Timesover a decade ago.
In it she confessed (guiltily) that she loved her husband more than her children.
She also said that if she lost one of her children, she could go on as long as she had her husband
(the novelist Michael Chabon). In the essay, she laments that in her “Mommy and Me” group,
she is the outlier when it comes to still being focused on her husband and maintaining
an active sex life after having children. “Why, of all the women in the room,
am I the only one who has not made the erotic transition a good mother is supposed to make?
Why am I the only one incapable of placing her children at the center of her passionate universe?”</p><p>The uproar over her 2005 essay continues today. She still stands by it.
“If you focus all of your emotional passion on your children and you neglect the relationship
that brought that family into existence   .  .  . eventually, things can go really, really wrong.
I have not been a perfect mother, but giving my children a sense of security in their parents’ relationship
is something that I feel really proud of,” she says.</p><p>Waldman knows what many of us who have older children know. Eventually, if everything goes according to plan,
those children will leave the house. And when it’s just the two of you once again,
your relationship is going to be lacking if you haven’t maintained your intimacy or your connection.</p><p>As it turns out, the Rancics and Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon aren’t selfish or crazy;
they are just ahead of the curve—the U-shaped curve.</p><p>Sociologist Ernest Burgess was one of the first people to study married couples.
In the 1930s he wanted to develop a scientific measure to predict the success rate of marriages.
In his longitudinal study of married couples, he found that beginning with newlyweds,
and as you went further along the married life spectrum, marital satisfaction was a U-shaped curve.
Marital satisfaction began plummeting after the wedding and then took a big downward dive
when the first child arrived—taking bigger nosedives with every subsequent child.
If the couple didn’t divorce while at the bottom, then marital satisfaction began increasing
when the youngest child left home. This wasn’t just true for the early part of the twentieth century. This is the norm.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/p1-cf44a9a7f97e2ad3dd1783203ef6108b.png" width="1099" height="539" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>John Gottman’s own longitudinal newlywed study found that for those couples who have a child
within an average of four years after getting married, 67 percent have a precipitous drop in marital happiness
in the first three years of the baby’s life. Measuring videos of conflict,
with observers blind to whether or not the couple had children,
the couples with children showed an increase in hostility and conflict.
But a third of all couples who became parents didn’t have a drop in relationship happiness,
so John chose to look closely at both sets of couples three months after the wedding.
Was there some difference he could see prior to the baby being born that could predict
which group the couple would be in post-baby?
What John found out in his longitudinal study of heterosexual couples was that the men
who were more respectful to their wives, and more accepting of their wife’s influence or opinions,
were more likely not to have a drop in marital satisfaction after children are born.</p><p>IF YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU WANT TO STAY HAPPY, THEN YOU BOTH MUST HAVE TWO MAIN GOALS.</p><p>These same men were also dramatically different while their wives were pregnant.
They’re involved, they talk to the baby, they compliment their partner,
telling her she’s beautiful and wise about how she’s caring for their baby in utero.
John and Julie were able to reverse this drop in marital happiness for 77 percent of couples in a two-day workshop,
which became their book And Baby Makes Three</p><p>If you’ve decided to have children and you want to stay away from the bottom of the U-shaped curve,
then you both need to have two main goals.</p><p>1  Both partners should work to stay involved during the pregnancy and birth of children.
Both should be involved as equally as possible with the new baby, whether they are same sex or heterosexual couples.
In heterosexual couples, studies show that dad’s involvement matters greatly,
and the secret to keeping dad involved with the baby is a good relationship with mom.
If there is low conflict and continued sex, then dad will stay involved with the baby,
and the couple is more likely to maintain marital happiness.</p><p>2  The second most important thing is for the two of you to maintain intimacy and connection.
You need to make your relationship a priority. If you don’t, you will fall to the bottom of
the curve and not get out for 18 years, if you don’t divorce first.
To maintain intimacy you need to talk to each other about your stresses, make time to connect (date nights!),
and avoid defensiveness, criticism, contempt, and shutting down or withdrawing from each other.
Review the chapters on conflict and sex if in doubt.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sleep-and-sex">SLEEP AND SEX<a class="hash-link" href="#sleep-and-sex" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Some of the biggest fears around having children is that it will be the end of your sex life,
there will be no more time for romance, for travel, for ambition, and your marriage and career will both suffer.
These things happen. As we’ve discussed, they happen in about two-thirds of all marriages.
Recall that we reviewed the fact that scientists from UCLA’s Center for Everyday Lives
of Families (CELF) spent four years studying the lives of young families—parents in their 30s with children.
Couples spent about 10 percent of every night before bed in the same room; mostly they were apart attending
to various child, home, and work matters. Most of couples’ conversations were about errands
and other things that needed to get done. If you choose to have a family,
it’s imperative to continue to carve out special time to focus on each other,
to continue to have a satisfying sex life, and to continue to build rituals for connection and intimacy.
The greatest gift for a child is a loving relationship between parents.
This is the foundation that he or she will build on for a lifetime.</p><p>Speed Dating</p><p>CHAPTER SUMMARY</p><p>The definition of family is diverse and can include children, adopted children, foster children, no children,
pets, friends, or your extended family.</p><p>The decision to have children or not can be a deal breaker. Be very honest and open about your wishes
to have children and how many you envision. Don’t enter into a marriage thinking you can convince your spouse
to have children or not have children later on.</p><p>The average cost to raise a child born in 2015 is $233,610. This doesn’t include college.</p><p>Your primary relationship is your relationship to each other.</p><p>Approximately two-thirds of couples have a sharp drop in marital satisfaction shortly after a child is born,
and this drop gets deeper with each subsequent child.</p><p>To avoid this drop in maritial happiness, fathers need to be involved in the pregnancy, the birth,
and caring for the baby, and conflict needs to be low and you need to maintain your sexual relationship.</p><p>The Date: FAMILY</p><p>CONVERSATION TOPIC</p><p>What does creating a family mean to each of us? Do we want children? How do we define family for our relationship?</p><p>PREPARATION</p><p>Reflect on what you read in this chapter and any ideas it sparked about what family means to you
and what you would like family to look like in your relationship.</p><p>LOCATION</p><p>A park or playground, an amusement park, or anywhere else
where children and families gather. Find a quiet spot where you can see the family activities,
but can still focus on each other and your conversation
(and some parks and playgrounds don’t allow you in them if you don’t have a child with you).
If you prefer to have conversation over dinner out, choose a family-friendly restaurant.</p><p>SUGGESTIONS</p><p>Ideally you’ll have children and families in your line of vision during this date.
It’ll either serve as inspiration for the family you’d like to create with each other,
or as inspiration to recommit to whatever birth control you have chosen.</p><p>AT-HOME DATE:</p><p>Each of you makes your favorite childhood dish—for example, tater tots, macaroni and cheese, or breakfast for dinner.
Share a meal together, and bring a photo of yourself as a child to share with your partner.</p><p>BRING</p><p>Your ideas about what kind of family you’d like to have, as well as your ideas for making
your relationship a priority if you choose to have children.</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING</p><p>Stay open-minded to your partner’s views about family.</p><p>Be honest about your desire to have children or not have children.</p><p>Don’t criticize your partner’s family—whether it’s in-laws or siblings or best friends who are considered family.</p><p>If you already have children, appreciate your partner for their support as a coparent.</p><p>Express your own values and needs from your partner in terms of family, and never criticize their values, needs,
or parenting style if you have children.</p><p>OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DATE CONVERSATION</p><p>Ask each other the following questions:</p><p>1 What does your ideal family look like? Just us? Us and friends and relatives?
If you want children, how many children would you like to have?</p><p>2 What are the ways in which your parents did or did not appear to maintain their closeness, love,
and romance after having children?</p><p>FOR COUPLES PLANNING ON HAVING CHILDREN:</p><p>1 What problems do you think we might have maintaining our intimacy in our future family?</p><p>2 What do you think you will love about being parents together?</p><p>3 What characteristics or qualities of mine would you like our child to have?</p><p>FOR COUPLES NOT PLANNING ON HAVING CHILDREN OR WHOSE CHILDREN ARE GROWN:</p><p>1 How are we going to create a sense of family?</p><p>2 Who do you consider our closest family (this can be friends or relatives)?
What do you want to do to deepen our relationship with our family or closest friends?</p><p>AFFIRMING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER</p><p>Take turns reading this affirmation out loud to each other. Maintain eye contact while reciting.</p><p>I commit to creating a loving family. If we do have children,
I commit to avoiding destructive conflict and continuing to make our relationship a priority.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="date6">DATE6<a class="hash-link" href="#date6" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Play with Me</p><p>FUN &amp; ADVENTURE</p><p>Our lives and relationships are better, brighter, and more fun when we remember to play, when we inject some adventure. When is the last time you and your partner tried something new together? When was the last time the two of you went on an adventure? When was the last time you laughed together? Acted silly? If you can’t remember, then you are in some serious need of a play infusion. Play is a necessary and vital part of our relationships. Plain and simple—couples who play together, stay together.</p><p>One of the big myths in relationships is that you need to have similar ideas about what constitutes fun and adventure to have a successful relationship. Of course it’s fine if you do, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t. The most important thing is to find all of the ways you can to play together and support each other in your separate adventures.</p><p>For many couples, play and fun is often the first thing to go in a relationship and the last thing to get done on the “to do” list. Long hours of work, family demands, and stress can suck the fun right out of a relationship. University of Denver psychology professor and codirector of the Center for Marital and Family Studies Howard Markman says, “The correlation between fun and marital happiness is high and significant. The more you invest in fun and friendship and being there for your partner, the happier the relationship will get over time.” Markman and his codirector, Scott Stanley, began a long-term study of over 300 Denver couples in 1996 using a questionnaire based on a “fun and friendship scale” the two developed. Although the study hasn’t yet been published, the findings are clear—couples who play, laugh, and make a “game” out of daily life are happier couples.</p><p>Shared fun, shared activities, and shared laughter all contribute to a stronger, happier, and healthier relationship. Psychologist Arthur Aron of the State University of New York at Stony Brook studied couples to see how participating in new activities would affect how each partner experienced the relationship. The more novel and arousing activities (not that kind of arousing), the happier the couples said they were with their relationship. The joy that people had having new experiences rubbed off on their feelings about their partner. If they were having fun with their partner, their partner must be fun. The bottom line is that play isn’t a luxury or an indulgence, but a necessity for a successful, happy relationship.</p><p>Play isn’t just about being with each other, it’s about connecting with each other. When we play together as couples, we’re developing our trust and intimacy. Just as play is how children learn to cooperate, play also creates cooperation in adult relationships. Whether you’re flying a kite, taking a hike, or playing a board game—when you play together you’re creating shared meaning and shared fun, and this in turn deepens the intimacy and connection you have with each other.</p><p>Dr. Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play, says that play is “an absorbing, apparently purposeless activity that provides enjoyment and a suspension of self-consciousness and sense of time.” Brown believes that “nothing lights up the brain like play” and that “we are designed to play throughout our whole lives, not just as children.”</p><p>So what does this mean in terms of our relationships and our quest for happily ever after? Brown says, “Play refreshes a long-term adult-adult relationship; some of the hallmarks of its refreshing, oxygenating action are: humor, the enjoyment of novelty, the capacity to share a lighthearted sense of the world’s ironies, and the enjoyment of mutual storytelling. These playful communications and interactions, when nourished, produce a climate for easy connection and a more rewarding relationship—true intimacy.”</p><p>Finding ways to play together as often as possible will help your relationship thrive, and making play a priority will help to create a relationship that is full of joy and happiness.</p><p>LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE</p><p>The emotional essence of play is laughter. You can play while you’re doing the dishes. You can play when you’re mowing the lawn. You can even play while you’re “working” on your relationship. Play is spontaneous. Play is joyful. Play is an attitude. Play is about friendship. Play is also a way of being in the world.</p><p>When you were first dating, you probably made lots of time for play. Dates were new and exciting and adventurous. You built a friendship and a romance on a foundation of play. This doesn’t have to end once you dive into a “serious” or long-term relationship. In fact, this is the time when you have to make an even more consistent and concerted effort to incorporate play into your everyday lives and into the fabric of your relationship.</p><p>“Everything was exciting at first,” said Kim, a newly engaged woman in her twenties. “We planned all these fun things to do together when we were dating. Surfing and amusement parks and concerts and baseball games. Now we’re living together and planning our wedding, and it feels like we just watch television or go to a movie when we have some free time together. We don’t make the same effort to do new things. I’m worried we will end up like one of those couples who sit in restaurants, year after year, with absolutely nothing new or interesting to say to each other.”</p><p>Kim’s concern is a common fear. It may even be hardwired, as our brain seems to need play and adventure for our optimal health and well-being. The adventure or seeking system is a driving force in all mammals. The seeking system in animals is what drives a squirrel to sniff out a nut, or compels all animals to search their environment for the resources they need to survive. Humans also have a seeking system, and this system is about exploration and, ultimately, curiosity. Animals may seek and forage for food, or a mate, but humans are highly developed. We seek new experiences, new understanding, and new meaning. And we seek the reward and pleasure that comes from these new experiences</p><p>When you feel pleasure, excitement, or euphoria, the neural network called the Reward System is at work in your brain. This brain circuit includes the neurons of the ventral tegmental, the basal ganglia, the prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. This system is also involved with learning, with motivation, and with our quest for the new and exciting in life. Dopamine is the chief neurotransmitter in the Reward System. If your brain gets flooded with enough dopamine, you feel euphoric and as if something wonderful is about to happen. Whether your favorite sports team wins, someone you love kisses you, or your boss praises your work, the pleasure you experience is the rush of dopamine stimulating your brain’s Reward System. When you experience something pleasantly new and unfamiliar, your brain gets a big fat dopamine-infused prize. It feels good. It drives us.</p><p>In relationships, the issue comes when two partners get this brain-prize in different ways. Julie can’t sit on the couch and read books on physics and satisfy the seeking system of her brain. John can. John’s brain (the brain of a man who can easily think of ten ways you can die at a picnic) will not get the same rush of pleasure that Julie gets from skiing at breakneck speeds down a mountain.</p><p>There are even some scientific studies showing that some people may have a genetic variant in their dopamine system that causes them to seek out riskier behavior and activities. These can range from heli-skiing to big-wave surfing to drug addiction. Cynthia Thomson, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, has identified what she calls the “Daredevil Gene.” This gene may limit the amount of dopamine that’s released for some people, causing them to seek higher and more extreme levels of adventure to get the same reward.</p><p>BASE CAMP</p><p>Imagine you have been together for a couple of decades. Now imagine your partner walking into the calm, quiet,
beautiful home you’ve built together over the years. You’re expecting your partner to discuss what’s for dinner,
or perhaps some plans you’re making for the weekend, but instead,
your partner announces that she has decided she needs to climb Mount Everest before she turns 50,
and she’s turning 50 very soon.</p><p>This is what happened to John approximately 16 years ago.
Julie announced she needed to take a group of women to Mount Everest Base Camp and maybe higher.
It was going to be the adventure of a lifetime, and the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.
John listened to Julie speak about how incredibly important this trip was to her,
and responded as the enlightened husband and marriage professional he was. “Have you completely lost your mind?”</p><p>“At first I thought she was a reckless nut who had to be kept in check. I didn’t say it out loud. I am a marriage therapist, after all, and I knew better. My second thought was what if she died? I was panicked and I was scared. I shared my fears with her.”</p><p>Luckily for John, Julie had been married to him long enough to know how best to respond to his panic and worry. She listened to him, acknowledged his fears, and reassured him as best she could. She went over the itinerary, the training program, the safety precautions, the costs, and all the little details, in hopes his worry would lessen. In the end, John finally agreed to her plan, provided she take a satellite phone with her and call him every day or two.</p><p>Julie embarked on a yearlong training program, climbing steep stairways all over Seattle while wearing a 40-pound backpack.</p><p>John notes, “She even asked if I wanted to go to Kathmandu with her. I pass out from altitude sickness on a ladder, and I knew you couldn’t order room service while trekking up Everest, so I declined,” recalls John. “She started interviewing Sherpas. I met them and thought they were all dangerous sleazebags who just wanted to sleep with the women. But still, I worked on accepting the fact that she was going on this trip. Finally, the big day came and she went. My major contribution was to save all my whining for when she returned.”</p><p>“In the end,” John continues, “I had to face the fact that this woman, the love of my life, is very different from me. She is an athlete, an explorer, and a true adventurer. Adventure for me is studying quantum mechanics and differential equations from the safety of my chair. Julie was a downhill skiing racer in college—going fifty miles an hour downhill. My God, why would anyone want to do that? But she wanted to partially climb Everest, and she’s my girl, so I had to understand what it meant to her and support her.</p><p>“I will never forget the look on her face in the photograph that was taken of her on Kala Patthar, a peak next to Everest, at 18,600 feet. That picture of Julie on Everest is the face of dopamine in action. I have the photo framed and up on our wall at home, because I have never seen her look happier. Ever.”</p><p>While John and Julie don’t find their mutual fun in extreme sports, they do find it in swimming, in adventures that don’t require insurance, in finding new places to kayak, and in traveling together to amazing destinations around the globe. They have learned to verbally share their disparate interests, while sharing together the play and fun that works for both of them.</p><p>FINDING COMMON GROUND</p><p>The key isn’t to force your partner to seek play and adventure in the same way that you do; in fact, the hard wiring of his or her brain may make this virtually impossible. This fundamental need to seek out the new, to be challenged, and to experience surprise is a part of each of us. It resides deep in our primitive</p><p>brains and never leaves us no matter how old we get. Each and every one of us longs for excitement and that overwhelming sense that something wonderful is about to happen.</p><p>For a couple, play and adventure is all about learning together, growing together, exploring together, and supporting the natural curiosity you both have. Adventure always involves the unknown, and as such, there is a hint of danger to it. Some people can tolerate more danger than others. Explore the ways you’re the same, explore the ways you’re different, and find your common ground. John and Julie found their common adventure is ocean kayaking in their Seaward double, an activity they both love to do.</p><p>“I love the water,” says John. “Julie likes to be active. I’m never going to climb mountains, but we found a place where her love of extreme sports and my general fear of anything more strenuous than reading could intersect. Kayaking. We put our kayak in the water, we push away from shore, and we escape from the demands of life and work and family. This type of play is a release for us. And more importantly, we found a place where our different styles of play could meet. It has brought us closer over the years. Every time we go kayaking, we are connecting. We have to trust each other on the water. Depend on each other. We face the challenges of the sport together, and this fires us up. It invigorates us individually and as a couple. Kayaking is our special time together away from the world. We laugh. We talk. We sing. We feel totally safe. We’ve never criticized each other while paddling. In the beginning we paddled around in circles and just laughed. We created a new shared experience and that has helped us to remain in love year after year of marriage.”</p><p>WE CREATED A NEW SHARED EXPERIENCE AND THAT HELPED US TO REMAIN IN LOVE YEAR AFTER YEAR OF MARRIAGE.</p><p>The need for adventure is universal, but the ways in which we seek that newness will be different. Not better, not worse. Not right, not wrong. Just different. For some couples an adventure is taking a cooking class when you’ve never cooked before in your life. Or taking an art class when you’ve only ever drawn stick figures. Adventure doesn’t have to happen on far-off mountaintops or at the risk of life and limb. At its core, it’s simply seeking what is new and different. It is anything that pushes you outside of your comfort zone, giving you that dopamine-induced thrill.</p><p>THE HONEYMOON FROM HELL</p><p>Doug and Rachel have made adventure an integral part of their relationship from the start. Unlike John and Julie, they have a very similar sense of adventure, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. They both crave thrills and have had to spend a small fortune on insurance. On their honeymoon they had many near-death experiences, which made their vows of “until death do us part” seem potentially a little too prophetic.</p><p>Rachel and Doug decided to spend their honeymoon visiting a friend and traveling around recently war-torn Guatemala. The country wasn’t at war when they visited, but they did hear many stories about death squads that made them wonder if maybe they should have gone to Hawaii or on a cruise like most newlyweds. They also didn’t have much money, with Rachel still in medical school and Doug in his first job out of college.</p><p>On one adventure they decided to climb to the top of a nearby volcano, which happily didn’t erupt, but turned out to be a grueling, near vertical hike up and a slippery mudslide down. After the many-mile, high altitude hike, Rachel collapsed into the canoe, and only Doug’s desire to demonstrate his manhood to his new bride compelled him to get his rubbery arms to paddle them back across the vast lake to their lodging.</p><p>On another occasion, they decided to ride horses through the jungle, which resulted in a death-defying gallop through low-hanging vines and tree branches with spikes. Finally, there was the river spelunking adventure, during which they had to carry lit candles in their mouths as they swam through the icy river water into the depths of a dark cave. At the end, after an hour swim, the candles now all doused, they were told to jump into the pitch-dark blackness, assured that a pool of water was waiting twenty feet below. It was one of the scariest leaps of faith. They decided it was sort of like marriage itself, held hands, and jumped.</p><p>After their honeymoon, the challenges of married life seemed rather manageable. They approach their marriage like an exciting mountain they want to climb, and they constantly seek out new experiences and adventures. Adventure and novelty have always added an element of excitement to their relationship and have helped them to see their whole life together as an adventure. Not every adventure has resulted in a near-death experience, but they’ve felt that meeting new challenges or having new experiences has helped to keep the spark of passion alive. “There is something about facing a challenge together that binds you closely and prevents you from taking each other for granted,” Doug says.</p><p>THE CHRISTIE BRINKLEY PHENOMENON</p><p>Feeling bound together after facing a challenge or engaging in a dangerous experience isn’t specific to Doug and Rachel. Research shows that the physiological response to fear is, in some ways, similar to the physiological response to arousal. Sweaty palms, racing heartbeat, or any other symptoms of fear and anxiety can be misattributed to sexual attraction. You don’t have to risk life and limb to feel charged in your relationship—try a roller coaster ride, or a scary movie, or any other activity that inspires fear in you or your partner—and see how much closer you feel after the experience.</p><p>We’ve all read stories of people falling in love after surviving a natural disaster or a plane crash. Think of supermodel Christie Brinkley, who survived a helicopter crash with a handsome man who was not her husband. Shortly after surviving the heli-skiing crash atop a mountain in Colorado, she declared she was in love with the handsome man and left her marriage. Her whirlwind marriage to her fellow survivor lasted a mere seven months.</p><p>Scientists know that the part of the brain where we experience fear—the right amygdala—is linked to the part of the brain where we experience sexual arousal. (So, you may be thinking, that’s why teenagers like to go to horror movies.) The two are so closely linked together that even Billy Joel didn’t stand a chance when his wife crashed onto a mountaintop with another man. There is also a hormonal factor at play when we embark on a new or exciting adventure: a little cocktail of dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylethylamine (PEA). PEA is the chemical cocktail that results in the natural high you feel when you fall in love. It’s what makes you capable of staying up all night talking instead of sleeping. PEA levels are also increased by high-intensity activities like skydiving (also by taking certain drugs and consuming large quantities of chocolate). Often we will lament the loss of those lovestruck days and nights when our energy for each other had no limit, but our bodies develop a tolerance for the effects of PEA (much like it does to caffeine and other substances) that is often mistaken for the end of love. It’s not. And by committing to understanding our need for adventure and continued exploration with our partners, we can reactivate the hormonal love cocktail at any time.</p><p>ADVENTURING TOGETHER</p><p>Our sense of adventure, and need for play, never goes away. It may go dormant or into hibernation, but it is still a fundamental human need that’s always there just waiting to be acknowledged.</p><p>As partners you can ask yourself these simple questions to figure out whether your relationship is suffering from a lack of adventure:</p><p>When was the last time you felt excited or curious while you were with your partner?</p><p>When was the last time you did something new together?</p><p>When was the last time you had the feeling that something wonderful was about to happen?</p><p>One indication that adventure is lacking is when one or both of you are seeking substitutions for the dopamine response and end up feeding the need for play and adventure (dopamine) with sugar, chocolate, junk food and, for some, alcohol, prescription drugs, and other mind-altering substances, whether legal or illegal.</p><p>In relationships where there’s no shared adventure or no adventure of any kind, there’s a kind of deadness and lack of vitality that sets in. The relationship becomes a series of tasks. It becomes mundane. There’s no surprise and you lose the spark that play and adventure naturally bring into the relationship.</p><p>There are many ways to have adventures together. A small adventure somewhere new and unknown can be a microcosm of the adventure of life. Go out in the world together and explore the unknown—whether that’s walking through a new neighborhood, trying a new type of food at a restaurant, traveling anywhere (even nearby), making new friends, talking to random strangers, turning off your cell phone for a day, or deciding to take a hip-hop class together. Newness is the key, so shake up your routines, try something different, and explore what play and adventure mean to both of you.</p><p>Adventuring doesn’t have to cost money, involve exotic locations, or put you in grave danger. Look at the world with new eyes and a new curiosity. Who knows what you’ll discover?</p><p>Julie loves to climb mountains. John likes to study math equations. Luckily for them, there is no correlation between couples having common interests and relationship happiness. What this means is, you don’t have to play in the same ways to be a happy couple or to keep the fun alive in your relationship. But you both still have to play. And share your solo play with each other in the form of pictures, stories, and discussing how it made you feel. You can have opposite interests when it comes to play and adventure, and still have a relationship that grows and thrives. But find the places, as John and Julie did with kayaking, where your play and adventure intersect.</p><p>Think about how each of you likes to play. If you haven’t played in a while, or nothing comes to mind, think back to when you played as a child. What was the most fun you had while playing? What type of play did you do that made you feel the most alive and the happiest? Now when was the last time you did that, or something similar to that? What about your partner?</p><p>When you’re thinking about building a career, or planning a wedding, or starting a family, it may feel odd to think about playing in similar ways. But as we’ve said, playing is important throughout our lives. Play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith has written over 50 books on what play means in our lives as children and as adults. Sutton-Smith says, “The opposite of play is not work—it’s depression.” When our lives are infused with play, we’re able to see the absurd in the serious and find excitement in the mundane.</p><p>A relationship without play is a relationship without humor, without flirting, without games, and without fantasy. We all need humor, laughter, and play. Romance is play. Banter is play. Taking a walk is play. You don’t have to join a sports league or carve out large amounts of free time in your week. You just have to bring a spirit of play into whatever you are doing. Play needs to be a priority. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that after all the work is done, then you will play together. It won’t happen. If it feels foreign at first, then schedule play into your weekly list of tasks to accomplish. Need to get the grocery shopping done? Make a game of it with your partner. Paying the monthly bills? See how flirtatious you can be with each other while writing out those checks. Your happiness individually and as a couple doesn’t consist of not having bad experiences, it’s about constantly generating good experiences. Remember the all-important ratio of positive to negative experiences during nonconflict interaction: 20 positive experiences for every negative one. Play is also how we do that. None of us wants to end up on the wrong side of the divorce statistics, and as Stuart Brown says, when you “take play out of the mix, a relationship becomes a survival endurance contest.” Doesn’t sound very romantic, does it? Playfulness is as necessary a quality as fidelity to keep your relationship vital and thriving.</p><p>Exercise</p><p>FOR THE FUN OF IT</p><p>Read through the list before your date.

What is the role of play and adventure in our lives?</p><p>PREPARATION</p><p>Think about how you like to play and what adventures you’d like to have.
Reflect on what you read in this chapter and any ideas it sparked about what play and adventure look like to you,
and whether your needs for play and adventure are being met. How would you like to play with your partner in the future?
What shared adventures can you have? Be curious about your own answers and those of your partner.
You may just surprise yourself and find a little surge of dopamine reward from just
the idea of playing and adventuring together in new ways.</p><p>LOCATION</p><p>Somewhere you’ve never been before or a familiar place used in a new way.
Try the park, the beach, on a rooftop, in your backyard, or swap apartments with a friend.
Consider climbing a tree and having your entire date and conversation sitting out on a limb.
Make the entire date happen in the bathtub or another body of water.
Follow a random car and have your date take place wherever that car ends up.
Feel free to come up with your own adventurous location. Be spontaneous and be curious about what might happen.
Try having your date at an atypical time for a date—early morning, middle of the night, when you both should be at work.
This date should be all about newness and excitement. Be creative. Be spontaneous.</p><p>SUGGESTION</p><p>You can look up hidden locations near you at AtlasObscura.com and explore one of them
with your partner as you talk through the questions. You can also explore Geocaches near you—a
kind of adult treasure hunt game—by logging into geocache.com and finding hidden treasure boxes
near you through GPS coordinates.AT-HOME DATE:Pick a beautiful location in or near your home.
Create a scavenger hunt for your partner to find the location or simply leave them a note telling them
where to meet you. Have a surprise picnic waiting for them when they find you.</p><p>BRING</p><p>You should bring the list and the items you circled as well as the top three things you’d like to do first.
Be prepared to discuss with each other the items you circled and the ways that you’d like to play,
or the things you would consider fun. Look for the items that you both circled.
These are the activities where your play and adventure interests intersect.
If there’s no overlap, remember that part of play and adventure is stepping into the unknown.
Which of the items that your partner thinks would be fun and playful are you willing to try?</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING</p><p>Stay open-minded to your partner’s ideas for play and adventure.
Remember that adventure involves the unknown and pressing against your comfort zone. Don’t minimize fears,
but try not to give in to them either.
Ask your partner questions about why their ideas about play and adventure are important and meaningful to them.</p><p>Don’t try to force your partner to do what you want to do or adventure in the way you want to adventure.</p><p>Listen for the excitement as your partner describes the adventures they want to have.</p><p>Don’t criticize or judge your partner for playing differently.</p><p>Take a leap of faith and embrace the unknown.</p><p><strong><em>OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DATE CONVERSATION</em></strong></p><p>After discussing and reviewing your lists, ask each other the following questions:</p><p>What does adventure/play mean to you?</p><p>How did you like to play when you were a child?</p><p>What’s the most fun you’ve had playing in the last few years?</p><p>How do you think we could have more fun?</p><p>Share with me an adventure story from the past.</p><p>What’s the most recent adventurous thing you did?</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"><span class="theme-last-updated">最后<!-- -->于 <b><time datetime="2023-05-14T06:33:16.000Z">2023年5月14日</time></b> <!-- -->更新</span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文档分页导航"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/EN"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">上一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">EN</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#eight-dates" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">eight dates</a></li><li><a href="#the-conversations-that-matter" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Conversations That Matter</a></li><li><a href="#重要的对话" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">重要的对话</a><ul><li><a href="#your-date-night" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Your Date Night</a></li><li><a href="#您的约会之夜" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">您的约会之夜</a></li><li><a href="#the-four-skills-of-intimate-conversation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Four Skills of Intimate Conversation</a></li><li><a href="#亲密对话的四个技巧" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">亲密对话的四个技巧</a></li><li><a href="#the-art-of-listening" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Art of Listening</a></li><li><a href="#倾听的艺术" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">倾听的艺术</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#date-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE 1</a><ul><li><a href="#date-2" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE 2</a></li><li><a href="#第二次约会" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">第二次约会</a></li><li><a href="#date3" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE3</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#date4" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE4</a></li><li><a href="#第四次约会" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">第四次约会</a><ul><li><a href="#date5" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE5</a></li><li><a href="#date6" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">DATE6</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#the-date-fun--adventure" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Date: FUN &amp; ADVENTURE</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Document</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">MIT Licensed | Copyright © 2023-present 张君歆 （Amos Zhang）.</div></div></div></footer></div>
