暂时找不到一个人赔我一起看这本书。英语不好，坚持看完需要勇气，试试看边看边翻译。

（机翻+小修补，翻译的肯定像shi一样，将就着这看吧）

有缘人如果正好英语也不好也许有用

### The Conversations That Matter

Every great love story is a never-ending conversation. From the first
tentative questions we ask as we get to know one another, to the nail-biting
discussions of trust and commitment, to the most profound heart-to-heart
explorations of our love, our pain, and our dreams, it’s the quality of our
questions and our answers that allow us to continue learning and growing
with one another through the years. And when conflict comes, as it
inevitably does when we weave two lives together, it’s our commitment to
being curious rather than correct that allows us to turn toward instead of
away from one another in the moments of disagreement. Whether you and
your partner are talkative or quiet, the words that pass between you, as well
as the expressions and gestures that accompany those words, will define
and determine your relationship. A true love story isn’t a fairy tale. It takes
vulnerability and effort. The reward is that you love your partner more on
your fiftieth anniversary than you did on your wedding night. You can stay
in love forever.

每一个伟大的爱情故事都是一场永无止境的对话。 从我们相互了解时提出的第一个试探性问题，
到对信任和承诺的尖锐讨论，再到对我们的爱、我们的痛苦和我们的梦想最深刻的心与心的探索，
它是我们间问题和答案的价值，让我们能够在这些年里不断学习，相互成长。
当冲突不可避免地出现在我们将两个人的生活交织在一起时，正是我们致力于“好奇”而不是“正确”，让我们在发生分歧时，转向而不是远离对方。
无论你和你的伴侣是健谈还是沉默寡言，你们之间的话语，以及伴随这些话语的表情和手势，都将定义和决定你们的关系。
真实的爱情故事不是童话。它需要示弱和努力。奖励是你们在五十周年纪念日比新婚之夜更爱你们的伴侣。你们可以永远相爱。

It can seem as if the success or failure of a marriage or long-term
relationship is no more certain than a coin toss. In the United States, we
hear that more than half of all marriages end in divorce. In Portugal, the
number is 70 percent. With second marriages in the US, the divorce rate
rises to 65 percent, and for third marriages the divorce rate climbs to 75 percent.
Those are bad odds. And those are just the folks who call it quits. What
about the couples who stay together in a state of quiet desperation,
discontent, and dullness? Before you throw your hands up in despair, know
that there is also hope.

似乎婚姻或长期关系的成败并不比掷硬币更确定。在美国，我们听说超过一半的婚姻以离婚告终。
在葡萄牙，这个数字是 70%。在美国，第二次婚姻的离婚率上升到 65%，第三次婚姻的离婚率上升到 75%。
这些概率真糟糕。而且那些仅包括退出婚姻的人。那些在平静的绝望、不满和沉闷中呆在一起的夫妻呢？
在你绝望地举手之前，要知道还有希望。

While the expectations for marriage and partnership have never been
higher, and the challenges have never been greater, it isn’t a coin toss. It’s
not chance. It’s choice.

虽然对婚姻和伴侣关系的期望从未如此高，挑战也从未如此巨大，但这并不是掷硬币。这不是偶然。这是选择。

We now know what couples can do to improve the odds.
For 40 years the Gottman Love Lab has been studying how to win at love.
In the lab in Seattle we have obtained synchronized observational, self-report, and physiological data from couples, and we have analyzed our data using advanced mathematical methods.
After observing thousands of couples, we now know the areas in a couple’s life that cause the most struggle.
We can tell you with confidence what separates the masters of relationship from the disasters.
And we can lead you through the eight essential conversations that will give you the best chance at creating your own happily ever after.

我们现在知道夫妻可以做些什么来提高概率。40年来，戈特曼爱情实验室一直在研究如何赢得爱情。
在西雅图的实验室中，我们从夫妻那里获得了同步观察、自我报告和生理数据，并且我们使用先进的数学方法分析了我们的数据。
在观察了数以千计的夫妻之后，我们现在知道了夫妻生活中最痛苦的领域。
我们可以自信地告诉您，是什么将关系大师与失败的人区分开来。
我们可以引导您完成八个基本对话，这些对话将为您提供最好的机会，让您从此过上幸福的生活。

Successful long-term relationships are created through small words,small gestures, and small acts.
A lifetime of love is created every single day you are together.
Getting to know your partner doesn’t end the minute you return the moving van and are sharing dresser-drawer space, or the minute you say “I do.” It never ends.
You can spend a lifetime being curious about the inner world of your partner, and being brave enough to share your own inner world, and never be done discovering all there is to know about each other.
It’s exciting.It’s daunting. And it’s one of the greatest life adventures you can take.
Trust us, we know. We’ve been married a long time; more than 30 years for John and Julie, and more than 25 years for Doug and Rachel, and we’re still discovering new things about each other, still
surprising each other, and more in love than we’ve ever been. That doesn’t mean our relationships are perfect.
Sometimes we fight. Sometimes we’re rude or insensitive.
Perfection is not the price of love. Practice is.
We practice how to express our love and how to receive our partner’s love.
Love is an action even more than a feeling.
It requires intention and attention, a practice we call attunement.
